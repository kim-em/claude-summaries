# Presentable

## Overview

The `Presentable/` directory formalizes the theory of presentable and accessible categories, implementing κ-presentable objects, κ-accessible functors, and locally presentable categories for regular cardinals κ. This provides the categorical framework for studying categories generated by small objects under filtered colimits, with applications to the theory of locally presentable categories as described in Adámek and Rosický's book. The implementation includes cardinal-filtered categories (generalizing filtered categories), generators, preservation of colimits, and the orthogonal-reflection construction for producing reflective subcategories.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core definitions of κ-accessible functors and κ-presentable objects; functors preserving κ-filtered colimits where κ is a regular cardinal |
| LocallyPresentable.lean | Locally presentable and accessible categories; defines `IsCardinalLocallyPresentable C κ` (cocomplete with κ-presentable generators) and `IsLocallyPresentable C` (exists such κ) |
| IsCardinalFiltered.lean | κ-filtered categories generalizing filtered categories; category J is κ-filtered if any functor from A with `< κ` arrows admits a cocone |
| CardinalFilteredPresentation.lean | Presentable generators; defines `IsCardinalFilteredGenerator` for object properties consisting of κ-presentable objects generating the category via κ-filtered colimits |
| Adjunction.lean | Preservation of presentability under adjunctions; left adjoints preserve κ-presentable objects when right adjoint is κ-accessible; equivalences preserve locally presentable structure |
| Limits.lean | Stability of accessible functors and presentable objects under limits and colimits indexed by categories with `< κ` arrows |
| OrthogonalReflection.lean | Orthogonal-reflection construction for morphism properties W; constructs `toSucc W Z : Z ⟶ succ W Z` in `W.isLocal.isLocal`; proves locally presentable categories have reflective localizations (Theorem 1.39 from Adámek-Rosický) |
| Directed.lean | Directed presentation of presentable objects; objects expressible as directed colimits of presentable objects |
| ColimitPresentation.lean | Colimit presentations for presentable objects; characterizes when colimits of presentable objects are presentable |
| Finite.lean | Finitely presentable objects as synonym for ℵ₀-presentable objects; equivalence with preservation of filtered colimits |
| Type.lean | Characterization of presentable objects in Type; X is κ-presentable iff `HasCardinalLT X κ` (cardinality < κ) |
| Dense.lean | Dense subcategories of presentable objects; density properties for generators |
| Retracts.lean | Retracts of presentable objects are presentable; closure properties under retractions |
| EssentiallyLarge.lean | Essentially large categories and their interaction with presentability |
