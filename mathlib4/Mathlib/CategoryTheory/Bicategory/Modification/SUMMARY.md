# Modification

## Overview

The `Modification/` directory formalizes modifications in bicategory theory, which are 2-morphisms between natural transformations of functors between bicategories. A modification between transformations η and θ consists of a family of 2-morphisms at each object satisfying naturality conditions. The directory provides modifications for both oplax and pseudofunctors, defining category structures where transformations are objects and modifications are morphisms with vertical composition.

## Key Files

| Pseudo.lean | Modifications between strong transformations of pseudofunctors with category structure and equivalences to oplax case |
