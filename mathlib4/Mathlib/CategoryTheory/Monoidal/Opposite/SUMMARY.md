# Opposite

## Overview

The `Opposite/` directory establishes the equivalence between monoid objects in a monoidal category C and monoid objects in its monoidal opposite C^Mop. It provides functorial constructions `mop` and `unmop` that convert monoid objects and their morphisms between C and C^Mop, along with the proof that these constructions form a categorical equivalence. This allows monoid-theoretic results to be transferred between a monoidal category and its opposite.
