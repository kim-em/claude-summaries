# Subpresheaf

## Overview

The `Subpresheaf/` directory implements the theory of subpresheaves for type-valued presheaves in category theory. A subpresheaf consists of a compatible family of subsets, one for each object in the category, that respects restriction maps. The directory provides the foundational definitions (subpresheaves with complete lattice structure, inclusions, and conversions to presheaves), image and preimage operations under morphisms, subpresheaves generated by sections, finite generation, equalizers as subpresheaves, sieves attached to subpresheaves, and formal comparisons with the subobject lattice. This infrastructure supports sheaf theory, Grothendieck topologies, and categorical approaches to descent and gluing.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core `Subpresheaf` structure with complete lattice operations, inclusion morphisms `ι`, top/bot subpresheaves, and naturality properties |
| Image.lean | Image and preimage of subpresheaves under morphisms, range of morphisms, lift operations, and epi/mono characterizations |
| OfSection.lean | Subpresheaf generated by a single section `x : F.obj X`, equivalence with range of Yoneda-represented morphisms |
| Finite.lean | Finitely generated subpresheaves (generated by finitely many sections) with typeclass `IsFinite` and closure under morphism images |
| Equalizer.lean | Equalizer of two morphisms as a subpresheaf, universal property, and limit fork construction |
| Sieves.lean | Sieve associated to a section and subpresheaf (`sieveOfSection`), compatible families of elements for sheaf conditions |
| Subobject.lean | Equivalence `Subpresheaf F ≌ MonoOver F` and order isomorphism `Subpresheaf F ≃o Subobject F` relating subpresheaves to categorical subobjects |
