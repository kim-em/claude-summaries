# FunctorCategory

## Overview

The `FunctorCategory/` directory contains deprecated redirect modules for closed structures on functor categories. All three files were deprecated on 2025-11-28 and forward to the new location at `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Monoidal.Closed.FunctorCategory`. These modules handle the closed category structure on functor categories, including basic definitions, completeness properties, and groupoid cases. This directory exists for backward compatibility during the library's reorganization of closed category theory under monoidal categories.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Deprecated redirect to Monoidal.Closed.FunctorCategory.Basic (basic closed structure on functor categories) |
| Complete.lean | Deprecated redirect to Monoidal.Closed.FunctorCategory.Complete (completeness properties for closed functor categories) |
| Groupoid.lean | Deprecated redirect to Monoidal.Closed.FunctorCategory.Groupoid (closed structure on groupoid functor categories) |
