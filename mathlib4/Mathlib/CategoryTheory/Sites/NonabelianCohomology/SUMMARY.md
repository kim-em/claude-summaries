# NonabelianCohomology

## Overview

This folder contains the implementation of nonabelian cohomology theory in degree 1 for presheaves of groups. The theory defines 1-cochains, 1-cocycles, and the first cohomology group H^1 for a presheaf of groups over a family of objects. Unlike abelian Čech cohomology, this formulation works for non-abelian groups and is only defined in low degrees.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `H1.lean` | Defines the cohomology in degree 1 for presheaves of groups, including zero-cochains, one-cochains, one-cocycles, cohomology relations, and the quotient type H^1. Includes TODO items for extending to sheaves and exact sequences. |
