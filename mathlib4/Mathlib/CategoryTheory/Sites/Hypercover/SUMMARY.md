# Hypercover

## Overview

The `Hypercover/` directory implements the theory of hypercovers and higher descent for Grothendieck topologies, extending the basic sheaf theory with increasingly sophisticated covering conditions. It provides 0-hypercovers (covering families with explicit index types), 1-hypercovers (covers with additional data for pairwise intersections), homotopy equivalences between 1-hypercovers, alternative characterizations of sheaves via hypercover conditions, and utilities for defining precoverages through hypercover families. This machinery enables more refined descent computations and provides computational tools for verifying sheaf conditions in practice.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Zero.lean | 0-hypercovers: covering families `{Xᵢ → S}` with explicit indexing, including pullbacks, intersections, refinements, and categorical structure; establishes relationship between precoverages and 0-hypercovers |
| One.lean | 1-hypercovers: 0-hypercovers plus covering data for pairwise fiber products, with multifork diagrams characterizing sheaf conditions; shows `F(S)` is multiequalizer of maps `F(Xᵢ) ⇉ F(Yⱼ)` for sheaves |
| Homotopy.lean | Homotopy relation on 1-hypercover refinements and quotient category HOneHypercover; proves the category of 1-hypercovers up to homotopy is cofiltered when C has pullbacks |
| IsSheaf.lean | Sheaf characterization via 1-hypercover families: topology generated by family H means presheaf is sheaf iff multifork is limit for all E in H; proves every topology is generated by 1-hypercovers of size max u v |
| ZeroFamily.lean | Alternative presentation of precoverages as predicates on 0-hypercovers stable under deduplication; establishes equivalence `Precoverage C ≃ PreZeroHypercoverFamily C` with criteria for base change and composition stability |
