# Types

## Overview

The `Types/` directory provides the complete implementation of limits and colimits in the category of types (`Type u`), showing that this category has all limits and colimits by giving explicit concrete constructions. It includes the general theory showing limits are computed as sections (dependent functions satisfying naturality) and colimits as quotients of sigma types, implementations for all specific shapes (products, pullbacks, equalizers, coproducts, pushouts, coequalizers), specialized results for filtered colimits with characterizations of equality, and connections to the Yoneda embedding showing how cones/cocones correspond to limits of hom-functors. These constructions serve as the fundamental examples of limits in concrete categories and provide the basis for understanding limits in other mathematical structures.

| Pullbacks.lean | Pullbacks in Type as subtype of product { p : X × Y // f p.1 = g p.2 }, limit cone construction, extensionality and existence lemmas for pullback squares |
| Pushouts.lean | Pushouts in Type as quotient of sum type by equivalence relation, inductive definition of pushout relation, limit cocone for pushouts |
