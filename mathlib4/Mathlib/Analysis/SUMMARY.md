# Analysis

## Overview

The `Analysis/` directory provides a comprehensive formalization of mathematical analysis in Lean, establishing the complete foundations for real analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis, and operator theory. This directory encompasses both classical analytical results (mean value theorem, fundamental theorem of calculus, Cauchy's integral theorem, maximum modulus principle) and modern functional analysis (Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces, C*-algebras, spectral theory). The architecture spans from basic definitions of analytic functions and asymptotic behavior through sophisticated theories of operator algebras and non-commutative geometry.

At the foundational level, the directory provides core analytical machinery: analytic functions (`Analytic/`) as power series expansions with composition and inversion theorems; asymptotic analysis (`Asymptotics/`) with big-O, little-o, and Theta notation for comparing growth rates; box integrals (`BoxIntegral/`) unifying Riemann, Henstock-Kurzweil, and McShane integration with the divergence theorem; and absolute value equivalence (`AbsoluteValue/`) characterizing when absolute values induce the same topology.

The calculus subdirectory (`Calculus/`) forms the analytical core, providing three complementary derivative theories (Fréchet derivatives for multivariable analysis, ordinary derivatives for real functions, and directional derivatives), smoothness classes C^n using formal multilinear series, and fundamental theorems including mean value theorem, implicit function theorem, inverse function theorem, Taylor's theorem with multiple remainder forms, L'Hôpital's rule, Darboux's theorem, and Rademacher's theorem on almost-everywhere differentiability of Lipschitz functions. This infrastructure supports practical computation with derivative formulas for all standard operations while maintaining theoretical rigor for advanced applications.

Complex analysis (`Complex/`) establishes ℂ as a normed field and develops classical holomorphic function theory: Cauchy's integral formulas, Liouville's theorem (bounded entire functions are constant), maximum modulus principle, open mapping theorem, Schwarz lemma, Phragmen-Lindelöf principle, and removable singularities. Specialized subdirectories cover harmonic functions (solutions to Laplace's equation), complex polynomials with the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, geometric domains (unit disc, upper half-plane with modular group actions), and Nevanlinna value distribution theory. The meromorphic function theory (`Meromorphic/`) extends this with divisors, orders, normal forms, and factorized rationals, proving the Gamma function is meromorphic on ℂ.

Functional analysis foundations are established through several interconnected components: normed spaces (`Normed/`, `NormedSpace/`) build the complete hierarchy from normed groups through normed fields and modules, proving fundamental theorems like Mazur-Ulam, Gelfand-Mazur, Hahn-Banach extension, Banach-Alaoglu, Riesz's lemma, and Banach open mapping theorem. Inner product spaces (`InnerProductSpace/`) develop Hilbert space theory with Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, orthogonal projections, adjoints, spectral theory for self-adjoint operators, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, Riesz representation, and Lax-Milgram theorem. Locally convex spaces (`LocallyConvex/`) formalize topology induced by seminorm families, proving Banach-Steinhaus and establishing weak topologies, barrelled spaces, and Montel spaces. C*-algebras (`CStarAlgebra/`) provide the framework for operator algebras with continuous functional calculus (unital and non-unital), Gelfand duality (equivalence between compact Hausdorff spaces and commutative C*-algebras), Hilbert C*-modules, and spectral properties. Von Neumann algebras (`VonNeumannAlgebra/`) capture both abstract (Sakai's predual definition) and concrete (double commutant) formulations.

Specialized analytical theories include: convex analysis (`Convex/`) with Jensen's inequality, Minkowski functional, extreme points, Krein-Milman theorem, Carathéodory's theorem, and Birkhoff's theorem on doubly stochastic matrices, plus subdirectories for convex cones (Farkas' lemma, Hahn-Banach separation), simplicial complexes, and convexity of specific functions; Fourier analysis (`Fourier/`) developing Fourier transforms with Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, inversion theorem, Poisson summation, Fourier series on the additive circle with L² convergence, discrete Fourier transforms on ZMod, and character theory on finite abelian groups with Pontryagin duality; distribution theory (`Distribution/`) formalizing Schwartz space (smooth rapidly decaying functions), test functions (smooth compactly supported), and connecting distributions to integration; ODE theory (`ODE/`) proving Grönwall's inequality and Picard-Lindelöf existence/uniqueness theorems; and special functions (`SpecialFunctions/`) covering exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, power, Gamma, elliptic, and hypergeometric families with complete analytical properties including Stirling's formula, Bernstein polynomial approximations (Weierstrass theorem), and explicit integral evaluations.

Additional components provide specialized tools: matrix analysis (`Matrix/`) with spectral theorem for Hermitian matrices, LDL decomposition, and functional calculus; polynomial analysis (`Polynomial/`) with asymptotic behavior, Cauchy root bounds, and Mahler measure; RCLike abstraction (`RCLike/`) enabling uniform treatment of ℝ and ℂ with extension of real-linear functionals; real number specifics (`Real/`) including cardinality results, hyperreal construction, positional digit systems, and comprehensive π theory (bounds, irrationality proofs, classical formulas); and specific limit computations (`SpecificLimits/`) for arithmetic-geometric sequences, Fibonacci ratios, and discretized exponentials.

Root-level files complement these subdirectories with fundamental concepts: bounded variation functions with almost-everywhere differentiability (`BoundedVariation.lean`), seminorms as the foundation for locally convex spaces (`Seminorm.lean`), convolution over additive groups with Haar measure (`Convolution.lean`, `LConvolution.lean`), mean inequalities including AM-GM, Hölder, and Minkowski (`MeanInequalities.lean`), p-series convergence with Schlömilch's condensation test (`PSeries.lean`), constant-speed parameterization via natural parametrization (`ConstantSpeed.lean`), Hofer's lemma for symplectic topology (`Hofer.lean`), oscillation of functions (`Oscillation.lean`), quaternion analysis (`Quaternion.lean`), Mellin transform and inversion (`MellinTransform.lean`, `MellinInversion.lean`), subadditive functions (`Subadditive.lean`), integral test for series (`SumIntegralComparisons.lean`), and summation over residue classes (`SumOverResidueClass.lean`).

Together, these components establish a complete foundation for analysis in formalized mathematics, supporting applications from basic calculus through advanced functional analysis, complex geometry, harmonic analysis, and operator theory. The directory's architecture balances theoretical depth (spectral theory, distribution theory, operator algebras) with computational practicality (derivative formulas, integral evaluations, asymptotic estimates), providing both a reference for classical theorems and infrastructure for cutting-edge formalization in mathematical physics, differential geometry, and non-commutative analysis.
