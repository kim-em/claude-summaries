# OperatorNorm

## Overview

The `OperatorNorm/` directory contains deprecated import modules that forward to the new `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.*` hierarchy. All modules were deprecated on 2025-09-03 as part of the normed space reorganization. The directory covers various aspects of operator norms for continuous linear maps, including basic theory, asymptotic behavior, bilinear operators, completeness properties, multiplicative structure, non-negative norms, normed space structure, and product constructions.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Asymptotics.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.Asymptotics` |
| Basic.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.Basic` (core operator norm theory) |
| Bilinear.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.Bilinear` (bilinear operator norms) |
| Completeness.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.Completeness` (completeness of operator spaces) |
| Mul.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.Mul` (multiplicative structure) |
| NNNorm.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.NNNorm` (non-negative operator norms) |
| NormedSpace.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.NormedSpace` (normed space structure) |
| Prod.lean | Deprecated import forwarding to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Operator.Prod` (product constructions) |
