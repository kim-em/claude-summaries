# SpecialFunctions

## Overview

The `SpecialFunctions/` directory contains C⋆-algebraic facts about positive and negative parts of elements using continuous functional calculus. The single file establishes spanning properties and decomposition results for C⋆-algebras in terms of nonnegative elements. Key results include that C⋆-algebras are spanned by nonnegative contractions, and every element can be written as a linear combination of four nonnegative elements with controlled norm.
