# SimplexCategory

## Overview

The `SimplexCategory/` directory contains the complete formalization of the simplex category Δ, which is fundamental to algebraic topology. The simplex category has natural numbers as objects (representing n-dimensional simplices) and monotone functions between finite linear orders as morphisms. This directory provides both the basic skeletal model and proves its equivalence to the category of nonempty finite linear orders, establishes all standard face and degeneracy maps that generate the category, defines the truncated simplex category for computations with bounded simplices, introduces augmented simplices and their monoidal structure, and proves properties about morphism generation and composition.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definitions of SimplexCategory with objects ℕ and morphisms as monotone maps Fin(n+1) → Fin(m+1); includes irreducibility attributes and notation ⦋n⦌ for n-simplices |
| Basic.lean | Establishes basic properties including equivalence to NonemptyFinLinOrd, defines generating morphisms (face maps δ and degeneracy maps σ), constant morphisms, diagonal maps, and proves epimorphism/monomorphism characterizations |
| Augmented.lean | Deprecated module that re-exports the Augmented/Basic.lean submodule for augmented simplex category theory |
| Rev.lean | Defines the covariant involution functor rev : SimplexCategory ⥤ SimplexCategory that reverses order (corresponding to opposite orders in finite linear orders); proves it's an equivalence |
| Truncated.lean | Proves initiality properties of the truncated simplex category inclusions, including that for n > 0 the inclusion Truncated n → SimplexCategory is initial, and provides abbreviations for face/degeneracy maps in truncated categories |
| MorphismProperty.lean | Shows morphisms in SimplexCategory are generated by face and degeneracy maps: any multiplicative morphism property containing all faces and degeneracies equals ⊤ |
