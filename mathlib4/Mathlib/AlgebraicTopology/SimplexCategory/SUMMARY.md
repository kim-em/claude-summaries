# SimplexCategory

## Overview

The `SimplexCategory/` directory contains the complete formalization of the simplex category Δ, which is fundamental to algebraic topology and serves as the indexing category for simplicial objects. The directory provides multiple equivalent perspectives on the simplex category: the skeletal model with natural numbers as objects and monotone maps as morphisms, the generators-and-relations presentation via face and degeneracy maps satisfying simplicial identities, and the augmented version with an adjoined initial object and monoidal structure. Key results include equivalence to the category of nonempty finite linear orders, epi-mono factorization of all morphisms as compositions of degeneracies followed by faces, normal form theory for morphisms via admissible lists, and the monoidal structure on the augmented simplex category where tensor products correspond to ordinal sums.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definitions of SimplexCategory with objects ℕ and morphisms as monotone maps Fin(n+1) → Fin(m+1); includes irreducibility attributes and notation ⦋n⦌ for n-simplices |
| Basic.lean | Establishes basic properties including equivalence to NonemptyFinLinOrd, defines generating morphisms (face maps δ and degeneracy maps σ), constant morphisms, diagonal maps, and proves epimorphism/monomorphism characterizations |
| Augmented.lean | Deprecated module that re-exports the Augmented/Basic.lean submodule for augmented simplex category theory |
| Rev.lean | Defines the covariant involution functor rev : SimplexCategory ⥤ SimplexCategory that reverses order (corresponding to opposite orders in finite linear orders); proves it's an equivalence |
| Truncated.lean | Proves initiality properties of the truncated simplex category inclusions, including that for n > 0 the inclusion Truncated n → SimplexCategory is initial, and provides abbreviations for face/degeneracy maps in truncated categories |
| MorphismProperty.lean | Shows morphisms in SimplexCategory are generated by face and degeneracy maps: any multiplicative morphism property containing all faces and degeneracies equals ⊤ |
