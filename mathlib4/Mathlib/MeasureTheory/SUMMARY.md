# MeasureTheory

## Overview

The `MeasureTheory/` directory provides the complete formalization of measure theory and Lebesgue integration in mathlib4. It includes foundational structures for measurable spaces and σ-algebras, measures and outer measures, abstract integration theory (both Bochner and Lebesgue integrals), and specialized topics including Haar measures on groups, covering theorems (Vitali, Besicovitch), vector measures, and connections to category theory. The root level contains core theoretical building blocks: π-systems and Dynkin's theorem, semirings and algebras of sets, and theorems connecting measure theory with topology.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| PiSystem.lean | Dynkin's π-λ theorem and induction principles for measurable sets: defines π-systems (collections closed under binary non-empty intersections) and Dynkin systems, proves that to check predicates on σ-algebras it suffices to check on generating π-systems with preservation by complementation and disjoint countable unions |
| SetSemiring.lean | Semirings and rings of sets: defines IsSetSemiring (families containing ∅, stable by intersection, where set differences decompose into disjoint finite unions) and IsSetRing (additionally closed under union), with key applications to intervals in ℝ |
| SetAlgebra.lean | Algebra of sets: defines IsSetAlgebra (families containing ∅, closed by complement and binary union, similar to σ-algebras but not necessarily closed under countable unions), proves generated algebras are countable when generated by countable families, shows σ-algebra generated by a family equals σ-algebra generated by the algebra of sets it generates |
| Topology.lean | Interface theorems combining measure theory and topology: proves that codiscrete sets within measurable sets are contained in the almost-everywhere filter for non-atomic measures on second-countable topological spaces |
