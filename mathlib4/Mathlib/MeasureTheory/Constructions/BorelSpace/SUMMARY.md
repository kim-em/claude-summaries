# BorelSpace

## Overview

The `BorelSpace/` directory defines the Borel σ-algebra as the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets, and establishes foundational measurability results for topological spaces. It provides `BorelSpace` instances for standard types (ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ, ℝ≥0, ℝ≥0∞, WithTop), proves that continuous functions are measurable, and establishes measurability of metric operations (dist, norm, infDist), order operations (sup, inf, limsup, liminf), linear maps, and coercions between numeric types. The folder also proves that Borel σ-algebras on linear orders can be generated from various interval types and that sequential limits of measurable functions in metrizable spaces remain measurable.

|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core Borel space theory: defines `borel α` as σ-algebra generated by open sets, defines `BorelSpace` typeclass (where `MeasurableSpace α = borel α`) and `OpensMeasurableSpace` (where all opens are measurable), proves opens/closeds are measurable, continuous functions are measurable, provides `BorelSpace` instances for Empty, Unit, Bool, ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℝ≥0, ℝ≥0∞, establishes `Continuous.measurable2` for combining measurable functions with continuous operations |
| Complex.lean | Borel space instance for ℂ: provides `MeasurableSpace` and `BorelSpace` instances for complex numbers and general `RCLike` types (ℝ-or-ℂ-like fields) |

| Order.lean | Borel σ-algebras on ordered spaces: proves `borel_eq_generateFrom_Ixx` for Iio, Ioi, Iic, Ici, Ico, Ioc (Borel algebra on linear orders generated by intervals), proves `Dense.borel_eq_generateFrom_Ico_mem` (dense subset endpoints suffice), proves measure extension theorems `ext_of_Ico`, `ext_of_Ioc`, `ext_of_Iic`, `ext_of_Ici`, proves semicontinuous functions are measurable, proves countable sup/inf of measurable functions to conditionally complete linear orders are measurable |
| Real.lean | Borel space for ℝ and related types: proves `borel_eq_generateFrom_Ixx_rat` for Ioo, Ioi, Iio, Ici, Iic (Borel algebra on ℝ generated by intervals with rational endpoints), proves `isPiSystem_Ixx_rat` for same intervals, establishes measurability of coercions `ℝ → ℝ≥0`, `ℝ≥0 → ℝ`, `ℝ≥0 → ℝ≥0∞`, `ℝ → ℝ≥0∞`, `ℝ≥0∞ → ℝ`, provides dot notation `Measurable.real_toNNReal`, `Measurable.ennreal_ofReal`, etc., proves measurability of ENNReal arithmetic operations |
