# Constructions

## Overview

The `Constructions/` directory provides foundational constructions for building measures on complex spaces from simpler components. It includes product measures for finite and countable families of spaces (via Pi construction and iterated products), projective limits of measure families (with foundations for Kolmogorov extension and Ionescu-Tulcea theorems), generalized polar coordinate changes for normed spaces (Haar measure on unit spheres), and cylinder-based measure theory for infinite-dimensional product spaces. The folder establishes the Borel space framework—defining Borel σ-algebras as those generated by open sets—with extensive measurability results for continuous functions, metric operations, linear maps, and sequential limits. It also develops the deep connections between Polish spaces and measure theory, culminating in the Borel Isomorphism Theorem and embedding results for standard Borel spaces. Specialized instances include the unit interval as a canonical probability space, measurable structures for quotient modules, and additive characters.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Pi.lean | Product measures on indexed families: defines `Measure.pi` for finitely many σ-finite measures on `(i : ι) → α i`, constructs iterated products via `tprod`, proves product measures satisfy `μ (pi univ s) = ∏ i, μ i (s i)`, supports Fubini/Tonelli theorems via marginal construction |
| HaarToSphere.lean | Generalized polar coordinate changes: for Haar measure `μ` on normed space `E`, constructs `μ.toSphere` on the unit sphere such that `μ` factors as product of sphere measure and radial measure with density `r^n`, provides integral rewriting for norm-only functions, estimates sphere measures |
| Projective.lean | Projective measure families and limits: defines `IsProjectiveMeasureFamily` for families `P : ∀ J : Finset ι, Measure (∀ j : J, α j)` where projections preserve measures, defines `IsProjectiveLimit μ P` for limits, proves uniqueness of projective limits for finite measure families |
| Cylinders.lean | π-systems of cylinders and square cylinders: defines `cylinder s S` as product of set on finite indices with `univ` elsewhere, defines `squareCylinders` and `measurableCylinders`, proves these generate the product σ-algebra, establishes π-system properties for measure construction |
| ClosedCompactCylinders.lean | Cylinders with closed compact bases: defines `closedCompactCylinders X` for Kolmogorov extension theorem, proves closed compact cylinders are measurable in second-countable spaces with measurable opens |
| ProjectiveFamilyContent.lean | Additive content from projective families: constructs `projectiveFamilyContent` on measurable cylinders from projective measure family `P`, proves measurable cylinders form a set algebra, provides foundation for projective limit construction via Ionescu-Tulcea and Kolmogorov extension theorems (not yet in mathlib) |
| UnitInterval.lean | Canonical measure on unit interval: provides `MeasureSpace` instance on `unitInterval` as probability measure with no atoms, proves volume formulas for intervals `Icc`, `Ico`, `Ioc`, `Ioo` and variants, establishes measure-preserving properties of symmetry map |
| AddChar.lean | Measurable space for additive characters: endows `AddChar A M` with discrete measurable space structure for finite discrete `A` |
| SubmoduleQuotient.lean | Measurability on quotient modules: provides `MeasurableSpace` instance for `M ⧸ p` (quotient of module by submodule), inherits discrete measurability |
