# MeasurableSpace

## Overview

The `MeasurableSpace/` directory contains the foundational theory of measurable spaces and σ-algebras in mathlib4. It provides the core definitions of measurable spaces (sets equipped with σ-algebras), measurable functions, and essential constructions such as product spaces, subspaces, and quotients. The directory includes both the basic axioms defining σ-algebras and an extensive library of properties, including lattice operations on σ-algebras, Galois connections induced by functions, measurable embeddings and equivalences, and specialized structures like countably generated spaces. Key theoretical results include the measurable Schröder-Bernstein theorem, cardinality bounds for generated σ-algebras, and characterizations of spaces that separate points.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definitions: `MeasurableSpace` structure, `MeasurableSet` predicate, `Measurable` functions, σ-algebra axioms (empty, complement, countable union), complete lattice structure on σ-algebras, `generateFrom` for smallest σ-algebra containing a collection, `MeasurableSingletonClass` and `DiscreteMeasurableSpace` typeclasses |
| Basic.lean | Properties of measurable spaces and functions: functors (`map`, `comap`) between measurable spaces with Galois connection, measurability criteria, monotonicity lemmas, countably spanning sets, compatibility with lattice operations |
| Constructions.lean | Measurable space constructions for standard types: countable types (Nat, Bool, Unit, ENat, Fin, ZMod, Int, Rat), ULift, product types (Prod, Pi), quotients, subtypes, with measurability results for projections and characteristic functions |
| Embedding.lean | Measurable embeddings and equivalences: `MeasurableEmbedding` (injective measurable maps with measurable image), `MeasurableEquiv` (measurable isomorphisms), measurable Schröder-Bernstein theorem (existence of measurable equivalence given embeddings in both directions), properties under composition |
| CountablyGenerated.lean | Countably generated measurable spaces: `CountablyGenerated` typeclass (σ-algebra generated by countable collection), `countableGeneratingSet` and `natGeneratingSequence` for explicit countable generators, `memPartition` measurability, `SeparatesPoints` typeclass, measurable injection into Cantor space `ℕ → Bool` for separating spaces |
| MeasurablyGenerated.lean | Measurably generated filters: `IsMeasurablyGenerated` predicate (every set in filter includes measurable set in filter), σ-algebra generated by singleton sets (equals comap to discrete space), characterization of sets measurable w.r.t. single-generator σ-algebras |
| Card.lean | Cardinality of σ-algebras: transfinite inductive construction `generateMeasurableRec` indexed by ordinals < ω₁, proof that this generates the full σ-algebra, cardinal bound `#(generated σ-algebra) ≤ (max #s 2)^ℵ₀` for generators s, continuum bound when #s ≤ 𝔠 |
| EventuallyMeasurable.lean | Measurability modulo filters: `eventuallyMeasurableSpace` (σ-algebra of sets equal to measurable sets modulo σ-filter), `EventuallyMeasurableSet` and `EventuallyMeasurable` predicates, applies to null-measurability (co-null filter) and Baire-measurability (comeager filter) |
| Invariants.lean | σ-algebra of invariant sets: `invariants f` for self-map f is σ-algebra of measurable sets s with f⁻¹(s) = s, measurability results for functions respecting invariant structures, characterization via semiconjugacy |
| Instances.lean | Standard typeclass instances: `MeasurableSpace` instances for Empty, PUnit, Bool, Prop, Nat, ENat, Fin, ZMod, Int, Rat (all with discrete σ-algebra ⊤), corresponding `MeasurableSingletonClass` and `DiscreteMeasurableSpace` instances |
| Pi.lean | Product σ-algebras for indexed products: π-systems of boxes, countably spanning properties of boxes, `generateFrom_pi_eq` (product of generated σ-algebras equals σ-algebra generated by boxes for finite index sets), measurability of projections |
| Prod.lean | Product σ-algebra for binary products: `generateFrom_prod_eq` (product σ-algebra generated by rectangles), π-system properties of rectangles, `comap` of products, measurable embeddings via `Prod.map`, measurability of `Prod.mk` with fixed components |
| NCard.lean | Measurability of set cardinality: proves `Set.encard` and `Set.ncard` are measurable functions when ambient space is countable |
| PreorderRestrict.lean | Measurability of restriction maps for preorder-indexed functions: proves `restrictLe` (restrict function to elements ≤ a) is measurable for functions indexed by preorders |
