# Algebra

## Overview

The `Algebra/` directory applies first-order model theory to algebraic structures, specifically rings and fields. It defines the language of rings (with operations +, *, -, 0, 1), establishes compatibility between model-theoretic structures and Mathlib's algebraic type classes, and develops theories for fields, algebraically closed fields, and their characteristic properties. This directory bridges the gap between abstract model theory (syntax, semantics, structures) and concrete algebra, enabling reasoning about rings and fields using first-order logic.

## Key Files
