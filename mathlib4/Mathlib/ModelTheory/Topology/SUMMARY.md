# Topology

## Overview

The `Topology/` directory defines the topological structure on the space of complete types from model theory. It equips the type `CompleteType T α` with a topology generated by basic open sets of the form `{p : CompleteType T α | φ ∈ p}` for sentences φ. This topology makes the type space a totally separated space with a clopen basis, fundamental for studying model-theoretic properties through topological methods. The file is kept separate from the main `ModelTheory/Types.lean` to avoid circular import dependencies with the topology library.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Types.lean | Defines topology on `CompleteType T α` generated by sets `typesWith φ := {p | φ ∈ p}`; proves these sets form a topological basis, are clopen (both open and closed), and that the type space is totally separated; authored by Jonas van der Schaaf (2025) |
