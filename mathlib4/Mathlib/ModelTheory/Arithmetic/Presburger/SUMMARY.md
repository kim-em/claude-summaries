# Presburger

## Overview

The `Presburger/` directory contains formalizations of Presburger arithmetic and related semilinear set theory. Presburger arithmetic is the first-order theory of natural numbers with addition (0, 1, +), a decidable fragment of arithmetic. The directory includes the language definition for Presburger arithmetic and a comprehensive theory of semilinear sets, which are fundamental to understanding the expressiveness and decidability of Presburger arithmetic.
