# Arithmetic

## Overview

The `Arithmetic/` directory contains model-theoretic formalizations of arithmetic theories, focusing on decidable fragments of arithmetic. Currently, the directory provides a complete formalization of Presburger arithmetic (the first-order theory of natural numbers with addition 0,1,+), including its language definition and the foundational theory of semilinear sets. Semilinear sets characterize the definable sets in Presburger arithmetic, and their comprehensive development here establishes Boolean algebra closure properties and the proper decomposition theorem (Ginsburg-Spanier). This work provides the semantic and structural foundation for understanding the expressiveness and decidability of Presburger arithmetic, a fundamental decidable theory studied extensively in model theory and automated reasoning.
