# Arithmetic

## Overview

The `Arithmetic/` directory contains model-theoretic formalizations of arithmetic theories. This directory serves as a container for specific arithmetic theories, currently focusing on Presburger arithmetic (the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition). Model theory of arithmetic studies the logical and semantic properties of formal systems describing arithmetic structures, including decidability, completeness, and expressiveness of various fragments.
