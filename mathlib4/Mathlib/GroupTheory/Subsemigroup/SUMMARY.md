# Subsemigroup

## Overview

The `Subsemigroup/` directory formalizes the theory of centers and centralizers as subsemigroups. It provides definitions of the center of a semigroup (elements that commute with everything) and centralizers of subsets (elements that commute with a given subset), along with their fundamental properties. These are the foundational subsemigroup-level constructions that are later extended to submonoids, subgroups, and subrings elsewhere in Mathlib.
