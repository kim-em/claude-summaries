# FiniteAbelian

## Overview

The `FiniteAbelian/` directory contains the fundamental structure theorem for finite abelian groups and finitely generated abelian groups. The main result establishes that any finite abelian group decomposes as a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order (ZMod (p^e)), while finitely generated abelian groups decompose as a product of a free abelian part (ℤ^n) and such a direct sum. Additional theory includes duality results showing that finite abelian groups are (noncanonically) isomorphic to their character groups when working over monoids with enough roots of unity.
