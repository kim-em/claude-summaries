# Order

## Overview

The `Order/` directory contains theory for ordered groups, specifically focusing on the concept of minimum order of elements in monoids and groups. The single file defines the minimum order of non-identity elements, proves equivalence with minimum subgroup size, characterizes when minimum order is infinite (torsion-free groups), and computes explicit minimum orders for ℤ/nℤ (the smallest prime factor of n).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Min.lean | Minimum order of monoid/group elements: definition as infimum of element orders, equivalence with minimum nontrivial subgroup cardinality, characterization for torsion-free groups (infinite minimum order), and explicit computation for ℤ/nℤ (minimum order equals smallest prime factor) |
