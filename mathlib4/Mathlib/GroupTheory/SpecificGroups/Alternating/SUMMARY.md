# Alternating

## Overview

The `Alternating/` directory contains advanced results about alternating groups beyond the basic definition. These files formalize centralizer computations for conjugacy class enumeration, the Klein four-group structure within A₄, and the O'Nan-Scott classification of maximal subgroups. The work includes cardinality formulas for even permutations of given cycle types, necessary and sufficient conditions for centralizers to lie in the alternating group, the characterization of the Klein four-group as both a 2-Sylow subgroup and the commutator subgroup of A₄, and maximal subgroup results including the intransitive case of the O'Nan-Scott theorem.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Centralizer.lean | Centralizer theory: cardinality of even permutations by cycle type, conditions for Subgroup.centralizer {g} ≤ alternatingGroup α (odd cycles, no repetitions, at most one fixed point), proof that A_n is perfect for n≥5 |
| KleinFour.lean | Klein four-group in A₄: kleinFour α subgroup generated by (2,2)-cycles, isKleinFour instance when card α = 4, characterization as unique 2-Sylow subgroup and as commutator subgroup |
| MaximalSubgroups.lean | Maximal subgroups: intransitive case of O'Nan-Scott classification, isCoatom_stabilizer theorem for set stabilizers when card α ≠ 2·ncard s, primitivity results for stabilizer actions |
