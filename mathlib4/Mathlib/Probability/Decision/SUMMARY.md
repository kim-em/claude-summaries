# Decision

## Overview

The `Decision/` directory provides formalization of decision theory in a probabilistic setting. It defines the framework for analyzing estimation problems where an estimator (randomized or deterministic) makes decisions based on observed data, and the quality of those decisions is measured by a loss function. The core concepts formalized include risk (expected loss of an estimator), average risk with respect to a prior distribution, Bayes risk (optimal expected loss), and minimax risk (worst-case optimal loss). The directory currently contains a single subdirectory focusing on risk theory for statistical decision problems.
