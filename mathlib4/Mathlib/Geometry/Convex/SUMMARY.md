# Convex

## Overview

The `Convex/` directory contains formalized convex geometry results that work without requiring a norm or inner product. This is a foundational approach to convexity that operates at a more general algebraic level than the norm-dependent convexity theory found in `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex`. Currently, the focus is on convex cones and their properties.
