# Group

## Overview

The `Group/` directory contains formalizations of geometric group theory, the study of finitely generated groups through their actions on geometric spaces. Currently, the primary focus is on group growth: given a finitely generated group G = <S> for some finite symmetric generating set S, the growth function n -> |S^n| measures how quickly the group expands under repeated multiplication. The results here establish that infinite groups have at least linear growth and relate the growth of a group to the growth of its normal subgroups and quotients.
