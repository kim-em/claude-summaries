# Geometry

## Overview

The `Geometry/` directory contains formalized geometric theories spanning multiple branches of mathematics. It encompasses Euclidean geometry (with inner product spaces, simplices, angles, circumcenters, and spheres), convex geometry (cones and convex sets without requiring norms), differential geometry (smooth manifolds with charts, atlases, diffeomorphisms, and tangent bundles), geometric group theory (group growth and actions on geometric spaces), and algebraic geometry foundations (ringed spaces, sheafed spaces, locally ringed spaces, and presheaves with stalks). This is a comprehensive geometric hierarchy connecting classical geometric intuitions with modern categorical and differential geometric frameworks.
