# LocalizedModule

## Overview

The `LocalizedModule/` directory implements the localization of modules at multiplicative subsets, generalizing ring localization to the module setting. Given a commutative semiring `R`, a multiplicative subset `S ⊆ R`, and an `R`-module `M`, this directory provides the construction of `LocalizedModule S M` as a quotient by the equivalence relation `(m, s) ≈ (m', s')` iff `∃ u : S, u • s' • m = u • s • m'`, equipped with canonical `Localization S`-module structure. The directory includes specialized constructions for localization at prime ideals and away from elements, proofs that localization is an exact functor, equivalence with ring localization via `IsLocalization`, integer elements (preimages of the localization map), and comprehensive submodule theory including Galois insertions and flatness.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core localization construction: equivalence relation `r`, quotient type `LocalizedModule S M`, canonical map `mk : M → S → LocalizedModule S M`, addition and scalar multiplication with `AddCommMonoid` and `Module (Localization S)` instances, lifting functions `liftOn`/`liftOn₂` for quotient operations |
| AtPrime.lean | Localization at prime ideals: abbreviations `IsLocalizedModule.AtPrime P` and `LocalizedModule.AtPrime P M` for localization at the complement of a prime ideal `P` |
| Away.lean | Localization away from elements: abbreviations `IsLocalizedModule.Away x` and `LocalizedModule.Away x M` for localization at the submonoid generated by `x` |
| Exact.lean | Exactness of localization: `LocalizedModule.map_exact` and `IsLocalizedModule.map_exact` proving that localization preserves exact sequences (localization is an exact functor) |
| Int.lean | Integer elements in localizations: `IsInteger` predicate for elements in the image of the localization map, clearing denominators with `commonDenom`/`integerMultiple` for finite sets, membership in localized spans |
| IsLocalization.lean | Equivalence with ring localization: `isLocalizedModule_iff_isLocalization` proving that `IsLocalizedModule` and `IsLocalization` are equivalent for algebra maps, conversion between `IsLocalization.mk'` and `IsLocalizedModule.mk'` |
| Submodule.lean | Localized submodules: `Submodule.localized'` (localization of submodule viewed as submodule of localized module), Galois insertion `localized'gi` between submodules before/after localization, `toLocalized` and `toLocalizedQuotient` maps, interaction with pointwise operations |
