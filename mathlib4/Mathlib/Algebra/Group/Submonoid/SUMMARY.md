# Submonoid

## Overview

The `Submonoid/` directory contains the complete theory of submonoids in Lean's mathlib4, providing definitions, lattice structures, operations, and extensive membership criteria for both multiplicative and additive submonoids. This directory follows a modular design where `Defs.lean` provides core typeclass definitions (`Submonoid`, `AddSubmonoid`, `SubmonoidClass`), `Basic.lean` establishes the complete lattice structure with closure operations and Galois insertions, and specialized files add operations (mapping, comap, products), membership criteria (big operators, finsupp products, directed suprema), and compatibility with other algebraic structures (group actions, units, opposite monoids, pointwise operations).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core submonoid definitions: `Submonoid M` structure extending `Subsemigroup` with `one_mem'`, typeclass `SubmonoidClass`, `OneMemClass`/`ZeroMemClass` mixins, `SetLike` instance, and `MonoidHom.eqLocusM` for equalizer submonoids |
| Basic.lean | Complete lattice structure on submonoids: `CompleteLattice` instance via `sInf`, `closure` operation as least submonoid containing a set, Galois insertion between closure and coercion, dense induction principles, and monoid homomorphism construction from dense subsets |
| Membership.lean | Advanced membership criteria and structural results: directed suprema (`mem_iSup_of_directed`, `mem_sSup_of_directedOn`), `powers` submonoid generated by single element, closure characterizations (lists, multisets, finsets), and induction principles (left/right, dependent) |
| Operations.lean | Operations on submonoids and homomorphisms: conversion between multiplicative/additive (`toAddSubmonoid`, `toSubmonoid'`), `comap`/`map` for homomorphisms, `prod` for products, `inclusion` embeddings, `mrange`/`mker` of homomorphisms, and monoid structures on submonoids |
| BigOperators.lean | Membership in products and sums: `list_prod_mem`, `multiset_prod_mem`, `prod_mem` for finite products, `coe_list_prod` for coercion lemmas, `noncommProd_mem` for non-commutative products, and `mem_closure_iff_exists_finset_subset` characterizing closure via finite support |
| Pointwise.lean | Pointwise operations on submonoids: `Submonoid.inv` for groups (inversion), `pointwiseMulAction` for scalar multiplication on submonoids, closure preservation (`closure_mul_le`, `closure_pow_le`), `coe_sup` for commutative monoids, and order isomorphisms via inversion |
| Units.lean | Submonoid of units and Galois coinsertion: `Submonoid.units` as subgroup of `Mˣ`, `Subgroup.ofUnits` coercing subgroup to submonoid, `ofUnits_units_gci` Galois coinsertion, `unitsEquivUnitsType` equivalence, and lattice operations on units |
| MulOpposite.lean | Opposite submonoids: `Submonoid.op`/`Submonoid.unop` converting between `Submonoid M` and `Submonoid Mᵐᵒᵖ`, order isomorphism `opEquiv`, lattice operations (sup/inf/closure) respecting opposite, and `equivOp` bijection between submonoid and its opposite |
| MulAction.lean | Group actions by submonoids: `SMul` instances for `SetLike` submonoid classes, `MulAction` instance when ambient monoid acts, `SMulCommClass` and `IsScalarTower` instances, `smul_def` relating submonoid action to ambient action |
| Finite.lean | Finite index results: `pi_mem_of_mulSingle_mem` showing product membership from single-coordinate embeddings, `pi_le_iff` characterizing order on pi-type submonoids, `closure_pi` computing closure of product sets |
| Finsupp.lean | Connection with finitely-supported functions: `exists_finsupp_of_mem_closure_range` expressing closure elements as finsupp products, `mem_closure_range_iff` characterizing membership via finsupp, `mem_closure_iff_of_fintype` for fintype index sets |
| DistribMulAction.lean | Distributive actions by submonoids: `DistribMulAction` instance for submonoids acting on additive monoids, `MulDistribMulAction` instance for actions on multiplicative monoids, both instances derived from ambient monoid actions |
