# Subgroup

## Overview

The `Subgroup/` directory contains the comprehensive theory of subgroups in Lean's mathlib4, providing the bundled `Subgroup` type and its complete mathematical infrastructure. At its foundation, it defines subgroups as sets closed under identity, multiplication, and inverses (Defs.lean), then builds up a rich lattice structure with closures, meets, and joins (Lattice.lean). The directory develops fundamental operations on subgroups including images and preimages under homomorphisms (Map.lean), kernels and ranges (Ker.lean), normal subgroups and normalizers (Defs.lean, Basic.lean), and pointwise operations (Pointwise.lean, Actions.lean). It also contains specialized theory for products, opposite groups, finitely-supported functions, order-theoretic properties, and even elements. The ZPowers/ subdirectory provides the theory of cyclic subgroups generated by powers of a single element, establishing the foundational case of generated subgroups. All definitions systematically support both multiplicative and additive groups through Lean's `to_additive` attribute, ensuring parallel development of the theory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definition of `Subgroup` and `AddSubgroup` as sets closed under identity, multiplication, and inverses; defines typeclass infrastructure `SubgroupClass`, `InvMemClass`, `NegMemClass`; establishes group instances on subgroups and defines the subtype homomorphism; introduces normal subgroups via the `Normal` structure and normalizers |
| Basic.lean | Fundamental theorems about subgroups including products (`H.prod K`), dependent products (`pi`), normal subgroups, characteristic subgroups, conjugacy, normal closures, normal cores, inertia subgroups, and lifting homomorphisms along surjections via `liftOfRightInverse` |
| Lattice.lean | Complete lattice structure on `Subgroup G` with top (⊤ = whole group), bottom (⊥ = trivial subgroup), infimum (intersection), supremum (generated by union), and the `closure` operator as a Galois insertion; includes characterizations of membership in sups and infs for commutative groups |
| Map.lean | Image and preimage operations for subgroups under group homomorphisms; defines `H.map f` (image) and `H.comap f` (preimage) with Galois connection; includes `subgroupOf` for viewing `H ⊓ K` as a subgroup of `K`, and order isomorphisms `MulEquiv.mapSubgroup` and `MulEquiv.comapSubgroup` |
| Ker.lean | Kernel and range of group homomorphisms; defines `f.ker` as the subgroup of elements mapping to 1, `f.range` as the image of the entire group, `f.eqLocus g` for elements where two homomorphisms agree, and proves fundamental isomorphism theorems and exactness properties |
| Pointwise.lean | Pointwise operations on subgroups including scalar multiplication actions and set-theoretic operations; establishes relationships between pointwise multiplication and subgroup closure; provides the infrastructure for treating subgroups as objects that can be acted upon by group elements |
| Actions.lean | Group actions on subgroups via conjugation and related operations |
| Even.lean | Even elements in subgroups (elements that are squares or in the range of `x ↦ x²`) |
| Finite.lean | Finiteness properties of subgroups; results about finite and infinite subgroups |
| Finsupp.lean | Subgroup structures on finitely-supported function types |
| MulOpposite.lean | Opposite subgroups and their relationship to the original subgroups |
| MulOppositeLemmas.lean | Additional lemmas about opposite subgroups |
| Order.lean | Order-theoretic properties and relationships between subgroups beyond basic lattice operations |
