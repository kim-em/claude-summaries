# ZPowers

## Overview

The `ZPowers/` directory develops the theory of cyclic subgroups generated by integer powers of a single element. It defines `zpowers g` (and its additive variant `zmultiples`) as the subgroup consisting of all integer powers `g^k` for `k : ℤ`, establishes its relationship to the closure of singleton sets, and proves fundamental properties including characterizations of membership, ordering relationships with other subgroups, and behavior under homomorphisms. The directory also contains specialized results for integer multiples in rings and connections to countability.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core definition of `zpowers g` as `Set.range (g ^ · : ℤ → G)` with proof that it forms a subgroup; membership characterizations (`mem_zpowers_iff`, `zpow_mem_zpowers`); equivalence to `closure {g}`; ordering results (`zpowers_le`, `zpowers_eq_bot`); commutativity of zpowers subgroup; inverse invariance (`zpowers_inv = zpowers g`); specialized theorems for integer divisibility (`Int.mem_zmultiples_iff`) |
| Lemmas.lean | Additional properties of zpowers including range of `zpowersHom`, countability of zpowers subgroups, ring-specific results for integer multiples (`intCast_mul_mem_zmultiples`), and the connection between `Int.castAddHom` range and `zmultiples 1` |
