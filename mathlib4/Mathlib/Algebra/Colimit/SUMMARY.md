# Colimit

## Overview

The `Colimit/` directory contains comprehensive theory for direct limits (colimits) of algebraic structures in directed systems. It provides two complementary approaches: a general `DirectLimit` construction that works for any algebraic structure (from magmas to fields) using explicit equivalence relations on directed systems, and specialized quotient-based constructions (`Module.DirectLimit`, `AddCommGroup.DirectLimit`, `Ring.DirectLimit`) built on universal objects (DirectSum, FreeCommRing) that provide universal properties suitable for category-theoretic reasoning. The directory establishes that modules are direct limits of their finitely generated submodules and includes results on tensor products with direct limits.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| DirectLimit.lean | General direct limit construction for algebraic structures: defines `DirectLimit G f` for directed systems with explicit equivalence relation, provides 400+ lines of boilerplate algebraic instances from `Mul` to `Field` using hom-polymorphic approach with `DirectedSystem` of `FunLike`s, proves universal properties for modules and rings showing these are colimits in respective categories |
| Module.lean | Module and abelian group direct limits: defines `Module.DirectLimit` and `AddCommGroup.DirectLimit` as quotients of `DirectSum` via additive congruence, provides universal property via `lift`, proves every element corresponds to some component via `exists_of`, establishes equivalence with general DirectLimit construction via `linearEquiv`, includes `of.zero_exact` (elements equal to zero are already zero in some larger component) and functorial operations (map, congr) |
| Ring.lean | Ring direct limits: defines `Ring.DirectLimit` as quotient of `FreeCommRing (Σ i, G i)` modulo ideal generated by compatibility relations, provides ring homomorphism `of` from components, universal property via `lift`, proves `exists_of` for element representation, establishes `ringEquiv` with general DirectLimit, includes `of.zero_exact` and `of_injective` (injectivity preservation), constructs noncomputable `Field` instance for direct limits of fields with multiplicative inverse |
| Finiteness.lean | Modules as direct limits of finitely generated submodules: defines `Module.fgSystem` (directed system of finitely generated submodules with `Submodule.inclusion` maps), proves `IsDirected` instance for FG submodules (sup is FG), constructs `equiv : DirectLimit _ (fgSystem R M) ≃ₗ[R] M` showing every module is the direct limit of its finitely generated submodules |
| TensorProduct.lean | Tensor products with direct limits: proves `exists_rTensor_fg_inclusion_eq` stating that for finitely generated submodule `N ≤ P`, two elements of `N ⊗ M` have the same image in `P ⊗ M` iff they already agree in `N' ⊗ M` for some finitely generated `N' ≥ N`, uses key facts that modules are direct limits of FG submodules and tensor product preserves colimits |
