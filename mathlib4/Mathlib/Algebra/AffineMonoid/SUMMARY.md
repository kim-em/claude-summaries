# AffineMonoid

## Overview

This directory contains the theory of affine monoids, which are finitely generated cancellative torsion-free commutative monoids. The core result establishes that affine monoids embed into ℤⁿ for some dimension n, which enables deriving important properties like unique sums/products. The theory includes structural characterization via irreducible elements and dimension analysis through Grothendieck group construction.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core definition: `IsAffineMonoid M` typeclass requiring cancellative, finitely generated, and torsion-free properties (with additive variant `IsAffineAddMonoid`) |
| Embedding.lean | Proves affine monoids embed into `ℤⁿ`: defines dimension `dim M` as finrank of Grothendieck group, constructs injective embedding `M →+ FreeAbelianGroup (Fin (dim M))` |
| Irreducible.lean | Shows finitely generated cancellative monoids with single unit are generated by finitely many irreducible elements, with minimal generating sets consisting exactly of irreducibles |
| UniqueSums.lean | Establishes `TwoUniqueSums` and `TwoUniqueProds` instances for affine monoids by transferring the property from `ℤⁿ` via the embedding |
