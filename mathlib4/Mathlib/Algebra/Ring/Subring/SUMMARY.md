# Subring

## Overview

The `Subring/` directory implements the theory of subrings in Lean 4, providing the bundled `Subring R` type (preferred over unbundled predicates) for subsets of a ring `R` that are closed under addition, multiplication, zero, one, and negation. A subring is implemented as a subsemiring that is also an additive subgroup. The directory establishes that subrings form a complete lattice, defines the subring generated by a set (closure), implements structure-preserving operations (map, comap, center, centralizer), and provides specialized instances for ordered rings, pointwise actions, and unit subgroups.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definitions: `SubringClass` typeclass (extends `SubsemiringClass` and `NegMemClass`), bundled `Subring` structure (extends `Subsemiring` and `AddSubgroup`), conversions to/from `NonUnitalSubring`, and basic instances (ring structure on subtypes, `IntCast`, natural/integer coercions) |
| Basic.lean | Complete lattice structure on subrings (top, bot, inf, sInf, sup instances), closure construction (smallest subring containing a set) with Galois insertion, map/comap operations along ring homomorphisms, center and centralizer subrings, range of ring homomorphisms, and extensive algebraic lemmas (membership, coercion, monotonicity, list/multiset/finset sums and products) |
| IntPolynomial.lean | Polynomial operations over subrings: `Polynomial.int` converts polynomials in `K[X]` with coefficients in a subring `R ⊆ K` to polynomials in `R[X]`, with lemmas for coefficients, degree, monic polynomials, and evaluation (useful for integral elements in field extensions) |
| MulOpposite.lean | Opposite ring operations: `Subring.op` and `Subring.unop` construct subrings of opposite rings, establish order isomorphism `Subring R ≃o Subring Rᵐᵒᵖ`, and provide lattice preservation lemmas (sup, inf, sSup, sInf, closure), plus bijections `addEquivOp` and `ringEquivOpMop` |
| Order.lean | Ordered ring instances: subrings of `OrderedRing`, `StrictOrderedRing`, `OrderedCommRing`, and `LinearOrderedRing` inherit the ordering, with `orderedSubtype` providing the inclusion as an ordered ring homomorphism |
| Pointwise.lean | Pointwise group actions on subrings: `Subring.pointwiseMulAction` defines scalar multiplication `a • S` as `S.map (MulSemiringAction.toRingHom a)` for monoids/groups/groups-with-zero acting on rings, with membership characterizations and subset lemmas (available in `Pointwise` locale) |
| Units.lean | Unit subgroups: `Units.posSubgroup R` defines the subgroup of positive units in a linearly ordered semiring with strict order, with membership characterized by `(0 : R) < u` |
