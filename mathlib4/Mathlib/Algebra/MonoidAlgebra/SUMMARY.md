# MonoidAlgebra

## Overview

The `MonoidAlgebra/` directory implements the construction of monoid algebras and additive monoid algebras, which are fundamental objects in algebra. A monoid algebra `MonoidAlgebra R M` (or `AddMonoidAlgebra R A`, denoted `R[A]`) represents finite formal `R`-linear combinations of elements from a monoid, equipped with a convolution product. This construction generalizes both group rings (e.g., `ℤ[G]` for a group `G`) and polynomial algebras (`Polynomial R = R[ℕ]`, `MvPolynomial σ R = R[σ →₀ ℕ]`). The directory provides comprehensive theory including algebraic structure (semiring/ring/algebra instances), support analysis, degree theory, grading structures, division operations, and the absence of zero divisors under appropriate conditions.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definition of `MonoidAlgebra R M := M →₀ R` and `AddMonoidAlgebra R M` with convolution multiplication, basic algebraic instances (semiring, ring, algebra), and the `R[A]` notation |
| Basic.lean | Extended algebraic structure: non-unital algebra homomorphisms, `liftMagma` adjunction (monoid algebras are free), `lift` equivalence for algebra homomorphisms, domain isomorphisms (`domCongr`, `mapDomainAlgHom`), range isomorphisms (`mapRangeAlgHom`), and equivariant linear maps |
| Support.lean | Support lemmas for multiplication: product support bounds (`support_mul ⊆ support × support`), single multiplication support equations, and span properties showing elements lie in submodules generated by their supports |
| Degree.lean | Degree theory with generic degree functions: `supDegree` (maximum exponent, valued in `WithBot A`) and `infDegree` (minimum exponent, valued in `WithTop A`), with bounds on degrees of sums and products |
| Grading.lean | Internal direct sum grading structure: `gradeBy R f i` submodules for degree function `f`, special case `grade R i` for identity grading, instances showing `AddMonoidAlgebra` is a graded algebra, and isInternal proofs |
| Division.lean | Division by monomials for `AddMonoidAlgebra`: `divOf x g` (quotient) and `modOf x g` (remainder) operations with division theorem `of' g * (x /ᵒᶠ g) + x %ᵒᶠ g = x`, and divisibility characterization via `modOf` |
| NoZeroDivisors.lean | Conditions for absence of zero divisors: shows `NoZeroDivisors (MonoidAlgebra R A)` when `R` has no zero divisors and `A` satisfies `UniqueProds` (resp. `UniqueSums` for additive version), including applications to left-ordered and right-ordered groups |
| ToDirectSum.lean | Conversions between `AddMonoidAlgebra M ι` and homogeneous `DirectSum (⨁ i : ι, M)`: bundled equivalences preserving additive, ring, and algebra structure, with canonical mappings between `single` and `DirectSum.of` |
| Module.lean | Module structure on monoid algebras: `MonoidAlgebra A G` as `A`-module, action of `R[G]` on modules via lift, and compatibility with scalar multiplication |
| MapDomain.lean | Domain mapping functoriality: `mapDomain` as homomorphism for monoid/ring/algebra structures, composition laws, and equivalences under bijections |
| Lift.lean | Universal properties and lifting constructions: `liftNC` (non-commutative lift), ring homomorphism lifts, and the adjunction between monoid algebras and coefficient rings |
| Ideal.lean | Ideal theory: characterization of ideals in monoid algebras and their relationship to ideals in the coefficient ring |
| Opposite.lean | Opposite algebra constructions: relationship between `MonoidAlgebra R Gᵐᵒᵖ` and `(MonoidAlgebra R G)ᵐᵒᵖ`, with equivalences and homomorphisms |
