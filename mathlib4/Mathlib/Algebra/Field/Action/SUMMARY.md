# Action

## Overview

The `Action/` directory contains theory about group actions of fields on themselves. Currently it focuses solely on the conjugation action `ConjAct K` of a division ring K on itself, providing the `DistribMulAction` instance that makes conjugation compatible with the additive and multiplicative structures.
