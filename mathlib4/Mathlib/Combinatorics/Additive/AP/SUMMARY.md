# AP

## Overview

The `AP/` directory contains formalized results about arithmetic progressions (AP) in additive combinatorics. Currently it focuses on 3-term arithmetic progressions (3APs), including the definition of 3AP-free sets (also known as Salem-Spencer sets), Roth numbers, and Behrend's construction providing lower bounds on Roth numbers. The directory contains fundamental results including that 3AP-freeness is preserved under Freiman homomorphisms, and Behrend's bound showing that sets of size `n / exp(O(√(log n)))` can avoid 3APs.
