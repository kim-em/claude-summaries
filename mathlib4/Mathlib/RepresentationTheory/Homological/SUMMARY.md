# Homological

## Overview

The `Homological/` directory develops homological algebra of group representations, focusing on projective resolutions of the trivial representation and their use in computing group (co)homology. It provides two fundamental projective resolutions: the standard resolution (alternating face map complex of the universal cover of the classifying space) and the bar resolution (with objects `Gⁿ →₀ k[G]` and differentials defined by group multiplication). The directory establishes exactness of these resolutions, proves their isomorphism, and applies them to define group cohomology and homology functors. Special treatment is given to finite cyclic groups with an efficient periodic resolution.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Resolution.lean | Defines standard resolution and bar resolution as projective resolutions of `k` as trivial `k[G]`-representation: standard resolution uses `k[Gⁿ⁺¹]` with diagonal action and alternating face maps, bar resolution uses `Gⁿ →₀ k[G]` with left regular action, proves both are exact via homotopy equivalence and establishes isomorphism `Rep.diagonalSuccIsoFree` between them, provides `Extⁿ(k, V)` isomorphisms |
| FiniteCyclic.lean | Projective resolution for finite cyclic groups generated by `g`: periodic complex `... → k[G] --N--> k[G] --(ρ(g) - 𝟙)--> k[G] --N-->...` where `N` is norm map, proves exactness by showing range/kernel relationships, provides functor from representations to periodic complexes, includes short complexes for computing (co)homology |
