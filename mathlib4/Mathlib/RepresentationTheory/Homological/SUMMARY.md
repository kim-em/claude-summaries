# Homological

## Overview

The `Homological/` directory provides a comprehensive development of homological algebra for k-linear G-representations, centered on two dual theories: group cohomology and group homology. The foundational layer (Resolution.lean, FiniteCyclic.lean) constructs projective resolutions of the trivial representation—both the standard resolution using alternating face maps on the classifying space and the bar resolution using group multiplication—proves their exactness and isomorphism, and provides specialized periodic resolutions for finite cyclic groups. Building on these resolutions, the GroupCohomology subdirectory develops Hⁿ(G, A) as the cohomology of inhomogeneous cochains, establishes the fundamental isomorphism Hⁿ(G, A) ≅ Extⁿ(k, A), and proves major theorems including Shapiro's lemma for coinduced representations and Hilbert's Theorem 90 for Galois extensions. The GroupHomology subdirectory provides the dual theory with Hₙ(G, A) as homology of inhomogeneous chains and the fundamental isomorphism Hₙ(G, A) ≅ Torₙ(A, k). Both theories include extensive machinery for low-degree computations (H⁰ as invariants/coinvariants, H¹ as homomorphisms/abelianization), functoriality with respect to group homomorphisms and representation morphisms, long exact sequences induced by short exact sequences of representations, and explicit formulas for finite cyclic groups in terms of the norm map and generator action. The directory constitutes a complete toolkit for computational and theoretical group (co)homology in the context of representation theory.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Resolution.lean | Defines standard resolution and bar resolution as projective resolutions of `k` as trivial `k[G]`-representation: standard resolution uses `k[Gⁿ⁺¹]` with diagonal action and alternating face maps, bar resolution uses `Gⁿ →₀ k[G]` with left regular action, proves both are exact via homotopy equivalence and establishes isomorphism `Rep.diagonalSuccIsoFree` between them, provides `Extⁿ(k, V)` isomorphisms |
| FiniteCyclic.lean | Projective resolution for finite cyclic groups generated by `g`: periodic complex `... → k[G] --N--> k[G] --(ρ(g) - 𝟙)--> k[G] --N-->...` where `N` is norm map, proves exactness by showing range/kernel relationships, provides functor from representations to periodic complexes, includes short complexes for computing (co)homology |
