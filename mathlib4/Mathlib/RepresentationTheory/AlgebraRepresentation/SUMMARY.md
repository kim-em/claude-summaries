# AlgebraRepresentation

## Overview

This directory contains foundational results about general algebra representations over algebraically closed fields. It provides Schur's lemma for algebras (every endomorphism of a simple module is scalar) and proves that finite-dimensional irreducible representations of commutative algebras are necessarily one-dimensional. These general results serve as the foundation for more specific representation theory results for groups, Lie algebras, and other algebraic structures.
