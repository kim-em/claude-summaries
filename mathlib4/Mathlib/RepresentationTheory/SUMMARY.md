# RepresentationTheory

## Overview

The `RepresentationTheory/` directory provides a comprehensive formalization of representation theory spanning general algebras, groups, and monoids, with deep integration of homological methods. The core layer develops two equivalent frameworks for group representations: unbundled representations as monoid homomorphisms `G →* (V →ₗ[k] V)` and bundled categorical representations `Rep k G` (defined as `Action (ModuleCat k) G`), with the categorical formulation proven to be a `k`-linear abelian symmetric monoidal category equivalent to `ModuleCat k[G]`. Finite-dimensional theory (`FDRep k G`) includes rigidity, monoidal structure, and character theory with orthogonality theorems for irreducible representations over algebraically closed fields. Structural theory encompasses invariants/coinvariants (with adjunctions and tensor formulas), subrepresentations, irreducibility (via simple order on subrepresentations), induced/coinduced representations (with adjunctions between induction/restriction functors and Shapiro's lemma machinery), and finite index isomorphisms between induction and coinduction. Key theorems include Maschke's theorem (semisimplicity when `|G|` is invertible in the field), Schur's lemma (both for groups and general algebras over algebraically closed fields), and Tannaka duality (recovering finite groups from `FDRep k G` as monoidal automorphisms of the forgetful functor). The `AlgebraRepresentation/` subdirectory establishes foundational Schur's lemma for general algebras and proves irreducible commutative algebra representations are one-dimensional. The `Homological/` subdirectory provides a complete homological algebra framework with projective resolutions (standard resolution and bar resolution, proven exact and isomorphic via homotopy equivalence, plus periodic resolutions for finite cyclic groups), group cohomology (Hⁿ(G, A) ≅ Extⁿ(k, A) with Shapiro's lemma, Hilbert's Theorem 90, long exact sequences, and explicit finite cyclic formulas), and group homology (Hₙ(G, A) ≅ Torₙ(A, k) with functoriality, long exact sequences, and low-degree computations). The directory constitutes a modern, categorical treatment of representation theory with full homological infrastructure.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Foundational definitions: `Representation` as monoid homomorphism `G →* (V →ₗ[k] V)`, trivial representation, constructions (direct sum, tensor product, dual, linear hom space, free representation), group representation properties (inverse formulas), and connection to monoid algebra modules via `asAlgebraHom` and `asModule` |
| Rep.lean | Categorical framework: `Rep k G` as category of `k`-linear representations (defined as `Action (ModuleCat k) G`), bundled representation type with coercion to type and `V.ρ` accessor, categorical equivalence `Rep k G ≌ ModuleCat k[G]`, proof that `Rep k G` is a `k`-linear abelian symmetric monoidal category with all limits and colimits |
| FDRep.lean | Finite-dimensional representations: category `FDRep k G` of finitely generated `k`-linear representations (with `FiniteDimensional k V` instances), Schur's lemma for irreducible representations (`finrank_hom_simple_simple`), monoidal structure, rigidity when `G` is a group, all finite limits |
| Character.lean | Character theory: character of representation as trace function `χ_V(g) = tr(ρ(g))`, behavior under representation operations (direct sum, tensor, dual, hom), orthogonality theorem for irreducible characters over algebraically closed fields (`char_orthonormal`) when characteristic doesn't divide group order |
| Maschke.lean | Maschke's theorem: every submodule of a `k[G]`-module has a complement when `k` is a field with `|G|` invertible in `k`, proven by averaging retractions over the group, implies every representation is semisimple (direct sum of irreducibles) |
| Invariants.lean | Invariant subspaces: subspace of vectors fixed by all group elements `{v : V \| ∀ g, ρ g v = v}`, projection onto invariants using group average element `⅟\|G\| • ∑ g ∈ G, of k G g` (requires `\|G\|` invertible in `k`) |
| Coinvariants.lean | Coinvariants functor: quotient of representation by submodule generated by `{ρ g x - x \| g ∈ G, x ∈ V}`, adjunction between coinvariants and trivial representation functors, tensor product formulas including `(V ⊗ k[G])_G ≅ V` and `(A ⊗ (α →₀ k[G]))_G ≅ α →₀ A` for group homology |
| Subrepresentation.lean | Subrepresentations: `G`-stable submodules of a representation, structure as submodule with proof of stability under `G`-action, induced representation on the subrepresentation, lattice structure, order isomorphism with submodules of `k[G]`-module via `asModule` |
| Irreducible.lean | Irreducibility: representation is irreducible if it has no proper non-trivial subrepresentations (via `IsSimpleOrder (Subrepresentation ρ)`), equivalence with simple `k[G]`-modules via `asModule` |
| Induced.lean | Induced representations: given group homomorphism `φ : G →* H` and `G`-representation `A`, defines `Ind_G^H(A) = (k[H] ⊗[k] A)_G` with `H`-action `h • ⟦h₁ ⊗ a⟧ = ⟦h₁h⁻¹ ⊗ a⟧`, adjunction between induction and restriction functors, preservation of colimits, Shapiro's lemma setup |
| Coinduced.lean | Coinduced representations: given `φ : G →* H` and `G`-representation `A`, defines `Coind_G^H(A)` as submodule of equivariant functions `{f : H → A \| ∀ g h, f(φ g · h) = ρ g (f h)}` with `H`-action `(h • f) h₁ = f(h₁h)`, adjunction with restriction functor, preservation of limits |
| FiniteIndex.lean | Finite index subgroups: isomorphism `Ind_S^G(A) ≅ Coind_S^G(A)` when `S ≤ G` has finite index, explicit formulas using coset representatives, natural isomorphism between induction and coinduction functors |
| FinGroupCharZero.lean | Maschke applications: every object in `Rep k G` and `FDRep k G` is both injective and projective when `|G|` is invertible in field `k`, simpleness criteria for `FDRep k G` over algebraically closed fields (simple iff `Hom(V,V) ≅ k` one-dimensional, or iff character inner product equals 1) |
| Intertwining.lean | Intertwining maps: equivariant linear maps between representations (unbundled `IsIntertwiningMap` predicate and bundled `IntertwiningMap` structure), morphisms satisfying `f(ρ g v) = σ g (f v)` for all `g ∈ G` |
| Submodule.lean | Invariant submodules: sublattice of `ρ`-invariant submodules via `invtSubmodule`, order isomorphism with submodules of the `k[G]`-module `ρ.asModule` via `mapSubmodule`, bounded lattice structure with top/bot |
| Tannaka.lean | Tannaka duality: finite group `G` can be recovered from category `FDRep k G` (for integral domain `k`) via monoidal natural automorphisms of forgetful functor, main result `G ≃* Aut(forget k G)` |
