# Lindemann

## Overview

The `Lindemann/` directory contains the analytic part of the proof of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, a fundamental result in transcendental number theory. This file establishes key approximation results needed to prove that certain exponential values are transcendental. The main result (`exp_polynomial_approx`) shows that for any polynomial with integer coefficients, one can construct approximations involving exponentials that become arbitrarily good, which is used in the full Lindemann-Weierstrass proof to establish algebraic independence of exponentials.
