# Transcendental

## Overview

The `Transcendental/` directory formalizes fundamental results in transcendental number theory, establishing both theoretical frameworks and explicit constructions. The `Lindemann/` subdirectory provides the analytic machinery for the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, including exponential-polynomial approximation results that prove transcendence of certain exponential values. The `Liouville/` subdirectory offers a complementary approach through Diophantine approximation: it proves Liouville's theorem (that numbers with sufficiently good rational approximations are transcendental), constructs explicit Liouville constants via rapidly converging series, and establishes measure-theoretic and topological properties showing that Liouville numbers form a dense Gδ set of measure zero. Together these provide both analytic transcendence criteria (via exponentials) and constructive approximation-based methods (via continued fractions and rational approximation).
