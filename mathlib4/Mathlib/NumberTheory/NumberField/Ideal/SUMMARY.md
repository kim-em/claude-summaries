# Ideal

## Overview

The `Ideal/` directory contains specialized results about integral ideals in rings of integers of number fields. This includes asymptotic counting formulas for ideals of bounded norm, basic results about roots of unity modulo ideals, and the Kummer-Dedekind criterion for splitting of rational primes. These results connect ideal theory to class numbers, torsion, and ramification theory.
