# Cyclotomic

## Overview

This directory contains the formalization of cyclotomic extensions of ℚ as number fields. Cyclotomic fields ℚ(ζₙ) are generated by primitive n-th roots of unity. The directory establishes the ring of integers as ℤ[ζₙ], computes discriminants, proves properties about ideals (ramification and inertia), demonstrates that certain cyclotomic rings are PIDs, shows that cyclotomic extensions are totally complex, and develops special results for the third cyclotomic field including Kummer's lemma.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Ring of integers of cyclotomic fields: proves ℤ[ζ] is the integral closure, computes discriminants via power basis, establishes primality of ζ-1 in prime power cases, computes norms, proves uniqueness of ring of integers for general n |
| Embeddings.lean | Proves cyclotomic extensions ℚ(ζₙ) with n > 2 are totally complex (nrRealPlaces = 0) and computes number of complex places as φ(n)/2 |
| Ideal.lean | Ideal theory in cyclotomic fields: unique prime above p in ℚ(ζₚᵏ), ramification index p^(k-1)(p-1), inertia degree 1 for primes dividing the conductor, general formulas for arbitrary cyclotomic fields via factorization |
| PID.lean | Proves ring of integers is PID for specific small primes: ℤ[ζ₃] and ℤ[ζ₅] are principal ideal domains via discriminant bounds and Minkowski theory |
| Three.lean | Special results for the third cyclotomic field: classification of units (±1, ±η, ±η²), Kummer's lemma (units congruent to integers mod 3 are ±1), divisibility properties of λ = ζ-1 |
