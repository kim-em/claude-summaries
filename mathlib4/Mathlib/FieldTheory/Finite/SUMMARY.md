# Finite

## Overview

The `Finite/` directory develops the theory of finite fields in Mathlib. It covers fundamental properties of finite fields (cardinality as prime powers, Fermat's little theorem, unit group structure), the construction and uniqueness of Galois fields `GF(p^n)`, extensions of finite fields with their Galois-theoretic properties, polynomial evaluation and indicator functions over finite fields, and explicit formulas for trace and norm maps. The directory establishes that finite field extensions are always Galois with cyclic Galois groups generated by the Frobenius automorphism.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Fundamental finite field theory: cardinality is `p^n` for prime characteristic `p`, Fermat's little theorem (`a^(q-1) = 1` for nonzero `a`), unit group is cyclic, Frobenius endomorphism `x ↦ x^q`, power sums over units, squares in finite fields, Fermat-Euler totient theorem |
| GaloisField.lean | Galois fields `GaloisField p n`: defined as splitting field of `X^(p^n) - X` over `ZMod p`; proves uniqueness of finite fields (`algEquivOfCardEq`, `ringEquivOfCardEq`), cardinality and finrank results, norm surjectivity, classification of `AlgHom` by finrank divisibility |
| Extension.lean | Extensions of finite fields: constructs `FiniteField.Extension k p n` as the unique (up to isomorphism) degree-`n` extension of `k`; proves extensions are Galois with cyclic Galois group, Frobenius `x ↦ x^(#k)` generates the Galois group |
| Polynomial.lean | Polynomials over finite fields: Frobenius equals expansion (`expand p f = f^p`), indicator polynomials for finite fields, `MvPolynomial.R` submodule of bounded-degree polynomials, evaluation surjectivity and kernel triviality for degree-restricted polynomials |
| Trace.lean | Trace and norm formulas for finite field extensions: explicit formulas `trace[L/K](x) = Σ x^((#K)^i)` and `norm[L/K](x) = Π x^((#K)^i)`, nondegeneracy of trace to prime field |
