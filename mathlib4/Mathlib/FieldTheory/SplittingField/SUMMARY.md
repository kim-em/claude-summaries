# SplittingField

## Overview

The `SplittingField/` directory contains the construction and characterization of splitting fields for polynomials. It provides both a concrete construction of a splitting field via recursive adjunction of roots and the typeclass predicate `IsSplittingField` that characterizes when a field extension is a splitting field. The construction proves existence and uniqueness (up to isomorphism) of splitting fields, establishes that they are finite-dimensional extensions, and provides embeddings from splitting fields into any field that splits the polynomial.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Construction.lean | Concrete construction of splitting fields: defines `SplittingField f` via quotient of MvPolynomial by kernel of evaluation map; constructs auxiliary `SplittingFieldAux` using recursion on degree by repeatedly adjoining roots of irreducible factors; proves splitting fields are finite-dimensional and any two splitting fields are isomorphic |
| IsSplittingField.lean | Typeclass predicate for splitting fields: defines `IsSplittingField K L f` requiring that f splits over L and L is generated by the roots; provides `lift` operation embedding splitting fields into fields that split f; proves compatibility with scalar towers, intermediate fields, and field embeddings |
