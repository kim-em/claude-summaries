# RatFunc

## Overview

The `RatFunc/` directory provides a formalization of the field of rational functions `RatFunc K` (denoted K(X)) over a field K, implemented as the field of fractions of the polynomial ring K[X]. It establishes the basic definition and field structure, algebraic operations, numerator/denominator extraction in coprime form with monic denominators, degree theory for rational functions, polynomial structure (constants C, indeterminate X, evaluation), and X-adic valuation. The implementation uses irreducible definitions for encapsulation and includes comprehensive lifting mechanisms for homomorphisms, making rational functions interoperable with other algebraic structures.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definition of `RatFunc K` as structure wrapping `FractionRing K[X]`; recursion/induction principles (`liftOn`, `liftOn'`, `induction_on`); basic constructor `mk` for building rational functions from polynomials |
| Basic.lean | Field structure implementation: arithmetic operations (add, sub, mul, div, inv, neg, smul), field instance, `IsFractionRing` instance establishing RatFunc as field of fractions of K[X]; numerator/denominator extraction (`num`, `denom`) normalized to coprime form with monic denominator; lifting homomorphisms (`liftRingHom`, `liftAlgHom`, `map`, `mapRingHom`, `mapAlgHom`) for extending polynomial homomorphisms to rational functions; characteristic and transcendentality properties |
| AsPolynomial.lean | Polynomial structure: constants `C : K →+* RatFunc K`, indeterminate `X : RatFunc K`, evaluation `eval : (K →+* L) → L → RatFunc K → L` with proper handling of denominators; X-adic valuation theory including `Polynomial.idealX` (principal ideal generated by X) and valuation properties for polynomials and rational functions; proofs of transcendentality |
| Degree.lean | Degree theory: `intDegree : RatFunc K → ℤ` defined as natDegree(num) - natDegree(denom); basic properties (degree of constants, X, polynomials, products, inverses, sums); bounds on degree of sums |
