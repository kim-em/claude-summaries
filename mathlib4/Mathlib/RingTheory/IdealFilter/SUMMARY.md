# IdealFilter

## Overview

The `IdealFilter/` directory contains the theory of ideal filters in ring theory. An ideal filter is a filter in the lattice of ideals of a ring. This module develops the theory of uniform filters, Gabriel filters, and torsion theory for modules with respect to ideal filters. It includes the Gabriel composition operation on filters and characterizations of Gabriel filters via uniformity and idempotence.
