# AlgebraicIndependent

## Overview

The `AlgebraicIndependent/` subdirectory formalizes the theory of algebraically independent families of elements in commutative algebra. A family of elements is algebraically independent over a ring R if the canonical evaluation map from the multivariate polynomial ring is injective, meaning no nontrivial polynomial relation holds among them. This includes the definition of algebraic independence, transcendence bases (maximal algebraically independent sets), transcendence degree, and results about cardinality and rank. The development covers both basic properties like preservation under injective reindexing and advanced topics like stability under base extension to algebraic closures.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definitions: `AlgebraicIndependent` (injectivity of MvPolynomial.aeval), `AlgebraicIndepOn` for indexed subsets, equivalence under reindexing, canonical isomorphism `aevalEquiv` to subalgebra, representation map `repr`, and `IsTranscendenceBasis` as maximal algebraically independent subsets |
| Basic.lean | Fundamental properties: transcendence degree as supremum of cardinalities of independent sets (`Algebra.trdeg`), algebraic independence iff kernel is bottom, relationship to linear independence, injectivity properties, preservation under injective algebra homomorphisms on the adjoin, more equivalences and characterizations |
| Adjoin.lean | Field-specific constructions for algebraically independent families over fields: canonical isomorphism `aevalEquivField` from fraction ring of polynomial ring to intermediate field generated by independent family, inverse map `reprField` |
| TranscendenceBasis.lean | Existence and uniqueness results for transcendence bases: every extension has a transcendence basis extending any algebraically independent subset, transcendence degree equals supremum over all transcendence bases, characterization of transcendence basis via universal property with respect to larger independent families |
| Transcendental.lean | Relationship between algebraic independence and transcendence of individual elements: singleton families are independent iff element is transcendental, independent families have all elements transcendental, algebraic extensions have no nontrivial independent families (isEmpty), transcendence degree zero iff extension is algebraic |
| RankAndCardinality.lean | Cardinal and rank formulas for transcendence bases: cardinality of field extension equals `max(#F, #ι, ℵ₀)` where ι indexes transcendence basis, module rank equals same formula, transcendental extensions have rank equal to cardinality, rank bounds for suprema of intermediate fields |
| AlgebraicClosure.lean | Stability under base change to algebraic extensions: algebraic independence persists when extending scalars from R to any R-algebra S with no zero divisors that is algebraic over R (`extendScalars`), applies to integral closures and algebraic closures, equivalence of independence over R and S for integral/algebraic extensions |
