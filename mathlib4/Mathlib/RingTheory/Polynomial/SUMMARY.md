# Polynomial

## Overview

The `Polynomial/` directory contains comprehensive ring-theoretic results about univariate polynomials `R[X]`. This includes foundational algebraic properties (polynomial rings over integral domains and Noetherian rings are themselves integral domains and Noetherian), GCD and unique factorization for polynomial rings, content and primitive polynomials, Gauss's lemma for irreducibility over fraction fields, classical named polynomial families (Chebyshev, Bernstein, Dickson, Pochhammer, Legendre), Vieta's formulas relating coefficients to roots, root scaling and integral normalization, quotients of polynomial rings, and advanced topics like Hilbert polynomials, Wronskians, and separable degree.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Foundational ring-theoretic properties: polynomial rings inherit characteristic, are Noetherian when base is (Hilbert basis theorem), `degreeLE` and `degreeLT` submodules |
| Content.lean | Polynomial content (gcd of coefficients), primitive polynomials, proves `(p * q).content = p.content * q.content` and that polynomial rings over GCD domains are GCD domains |
| ContentIdeal.lean | Content ideal (ideal generated by coefficients), Gauss-type results for when content ideals are the whole ring |
| GaussLemma.lean | Gauss's lemma: monic polynomials over integrally closed domains are irreducible iff irreducible over fraction field; primitive polynomials over GCD domains similarly |
| GaussNorm.lean | Gauss norm for polynomials (supremum of absolute values of coefficients times powers of c) |
| UniqueFactorization.lean | Polynomial rings over UFDs are UFDs; `WfDvdMonoid` instance for polynomial rings |
| Chebyshev.lean | Chebyshev polynomials T_n and U_n (first and second kind), rescaled versions C_n and S_n (Vieta-Lucas and Vieta-Fibonacci), composition and product formulas |
| Bernstein.lean | Bernstein polynomials `(n choose k) * X^k * (1-X)^(n-k)`, linear independence over rationals, summation identities |
| Dickson.lean | Dickson polynomials (generalized Chebyshev with parameter a), composition formula, characteristic p congruence |
| Pochhammer.lean | Ascending and descending Pochhammer polynomials (rising/falling factorials as polynomials) |
| HilbertPoly.lean | Hilbert polynomials for power series expansions p/(1-X)^d, preHilbertPoly definitions |
| Vieta.lean | Vieta's formulas: product of (X + root) equals sum of elementary symmetric functions times powers of X |
| SmallDegreeVieta.lean | Explicit Vieta's formulas for quadratic polynomials |
| ScaleRoots.lean | `scaleRoots p s` produces polynomial with roots scaled by s |
| IntegralNormalization.lean | `integralNormalization` transforms polynomial to monic with scaled roots |
| RationalRoot.lean | Rational/integral root theorem: roots of monic integer polynomials are integers; UFDs are integrally closed |
| Quotient.lean | Quotient ring isomorphisms like `R[X] / (X - a) ≃ R`, higher quotient structures |
| Ideal.lean | Ideals in polynomial rings, kernel of evaluation homomorphism |
| DegreeLT.lean | Basis for polynomials of degree < n, Taylor linear automorphism, Sylvester matrix preparation |
| Nilpotent.lean | Nilpotency in polynomial rings: polynomial is nilpotent iff all coefficients are |
| IrreducibleRing.lean | Irreducibility criteria for polynomials over rings with unique minimal prime |
| IsIntegral.lean | Integrality of polynomial coefficients: if monic p divides monic with integral coefficients, then p has integral coefficients |
| Opposites.lean | Isomorphism between R[X]^mop and R^mop[X] |
| Radical.lean | Radical of polynomials over fields, `divRadical` divides derivative |
| SeparableDegree.lean | Separable contraction and separable degree of polynomials |
| Selmer.lean | Irreducibility of Selmer polynomials X^n - X - 1 |
| ShiftedLegendre.lean | Shifted Legendre polynomials, Rodrigues' formula analogue |
| Wronskian.lean | Wronskian W(a,b) = ab' - a'b as bilinear map, degree bounds |
