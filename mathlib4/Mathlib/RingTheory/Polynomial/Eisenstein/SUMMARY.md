# Eisenstein

## Overview

The `Eisenstein/` directory contains the theory of Eisenstein polynomials and the classical Eisenstein irreducibility criterion. A polynomial `f : R[X]` is Eisenstein at an ideal `𝓟` if its leading coefficient is not in `𝓟`, all non-leading coefficients are in `𝓟`, and the constant term is not in `𝓟^2`. The main result proves that primitive Eisenstein polynomials at prime ideals are irreducible. The directory also defines weakly Eisenstein and distinguished polynomials, provides a generalized Eisenstein criterion, and includes integrality results for algebraic extensions generated by Eisenstein polynomials.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Defines `IsWeaklyEisensteinAt` (all non-leading coefficients in ideal) and `IsEisensteinAt` (additionally: leading coeff not in ideal, constant term not in ideal²); proves irreducibility of primitive Eisenstein polynomials at prime ideals; main entry point re-exporting Criterion.lean |
| Criterion.lean | Generalized Eisenstein criterion: proves irreducibility when image in extension field `K[X]` is a power of a monic prime, with mod `P^2` non-vanishing condition; includes classic `irreducible_of_eisenstein_criterion` as special case where `q := X` |
| Distinguished.lean | Defines `IsDistinguishedAt` (monic + weakly Eisenstein), proves distinguished polynomials multiply, shows they map to pure powers of X in quotient ring, relates degree to power series order |
| IsIntegral.lean | Advanced integrality results: proves `mem_adjoin_of_smul_prime_pow_smul_of_minpoly_isEisensteinAt` for computing rings of integers in extensions generated by Eisenstein polynomials; includes cyclotomic examples like `cyclotomic_comp_X_add_one_isEisensteinAt` |
