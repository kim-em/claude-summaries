# Localization

## Overview

This directory formalizes the localization of commutative rings at multiplicative submonoids. The core concept is the `IsLocalization M S` typeclass expressing that an R-algebra S is the localization of R at submonoid M, characterized by three properties: elements of M become units, all elements of S can be expressed as fractions, and the kernel is controlled by M. The development includes the fraction ring/field construction (`IsFractionRing`), localization at prime ideals (`AtPrime`), localization away from an element, and extensive theory connecting localization with ideals, modules, integrality, and algebraic extensions.
