# Spectrum

## Overview

The `Spectrum/` directory contains the formalization of the prime spectrum (Spec R) and maximal spectrum (mSpec R) of commutative rings, which are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry. The prime spectrum is the type of all prime ideals endowed with the Zariski topology, forming a spectral space that serves as the foundation for scheme theory. The maximal spectrum is the subset of maximal ideals, naturally embedded in the prime spectrum with the subspace topology.
