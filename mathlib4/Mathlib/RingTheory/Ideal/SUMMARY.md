# Ideal

## Overview

The `Ideal/` directory contains the core theory of ideals in commutative and non-commutative rings. Ideals are implemented as `Submodule R R`, interpreting scalar multiplication as ring multiplication. This directory provides fundamental definitions (ideal construction, two-sided ideals, prime and maximal ideals), operations (maps, comap, products, quotients, span), structural properties (height, primality, principality, primary decomposition), and specialized topics (cotangent modules, associated primes, ideal norms). It includes major theorems like Krull's height theorem and going-up/going-down lemmas for ring extensions.
