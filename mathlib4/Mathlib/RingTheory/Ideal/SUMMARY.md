# Ideal

## Overview

The `Ideal/` directory contains the comprehensive theory of ideals in commutative and non-commutative rings, serving as the foundation for much of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra in mathlib. Ideals are implemented as `Submodule R R`, interpreting scalar multiplication as ring multiplication. This directory provides fundamental definitions (ideal construction, two-sided ideals, prime and maximal ideals), operations (maps, comap, products, quotients, span), structural properties (height, primality, principality), and major theorems including Krull's height theorem and the going-up/going-down lemmas for ring extensions.

The subdirectories extend this foundation to specialized topics: `AssociatedPrime/` develops the theory connecting modules to their associated primes (proving finiteness for Noetherian modules and characterizing zero divisors); `MinimalPrime/` establishes minimal primes over ideals and their relationship to radicals; `Norm/` defines absolute and relative ideal norms for ring extensions (crucial for algebraic number theory); and `Quotient/` provides the complete theory of quotient rings including isomorphism theorems, the Chinese remainder theorem, and preservation of Noetherian properties.
