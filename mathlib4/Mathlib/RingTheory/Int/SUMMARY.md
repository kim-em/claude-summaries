# Int

## Overview

The `Int/` directory contains ring-theoretic properties specific to the integers (ℤ). This focuses on divisibility results that rely on ring theory, prime factorization, and the special structure of integers as a principal ideal domain and Euclidean domain. Key topics include the relationship between primality in ℤ and ℕ, coprimality and gcd properties, prime divisibility in products and powers, and extraction of perfect powers from coprime factorizations.
