# Presentation

## Overview

The `Presentation/` directory formalizes the theory of presentations of algebras and submersive presentations. A presentation consists of generators together with a family of relations (polynomials in those generators that span the kernel). Submersive presentations are finite presentations with fewer relations than generators, equipped with an invertible Jacobian determinant. These are fundamental structures in algebraic geometry, particularly for defining standard smooth algebras.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core definitions: `Algebra.Presentation` structure (generators plus relations that span the kernel); presentation dimension (generators minus relations); constructions for localization, base change, composition, reindexing; `ofFinitePresentation` for finitely presented algebras; relationship between finite presentations and finite type algebras |
| Submersive.lean | Defines `PreSubmersivePresentation` (presentation with injective map from relations to generators) and `SubmersivePresentation` (finite presubmersive presentation with invertible Jacobian); differential and Jacobi matrix constructions; Jacobian computations for localization, composition (product formula), base change; `basisDeriv` showing partial derivatives form a basis when presentation is submersive |
| Core.lean | API for presentations on subrings: `HasCoeffs R₀` property (coefficients of relations lie in R₀); `core` (subalgebra generated by coefficients); `ModelOfHasCoeffs` (quotient R₀[X]/relations as model for base extension); `tensorModelOfHasCoeffsEquiv` showing R ⊗[R₀] S₀ ≃ₐ[R] S; descent of (pre)submersive presentations to coefficient subrings; used to remove Noetherian hypotheses by descending to finitely generated coefficient rings |
