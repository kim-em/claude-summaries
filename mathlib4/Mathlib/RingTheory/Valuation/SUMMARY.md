# Valuation

## Overview

The `Valuation/` directory provides a comprehensive formalization of valuation theory on rings and fields, along with an alternative approach via valuative relations. The core theory defines valuations as monoid homomorphisms to linearly ordered monoids satisfying the ultrametric inequality v(x+y) ≤ max(v x, v y), and develops associated structures including valuation rings (domains with total divisibility), valuation subrings (maximal local subrings), and rings of integers (elements with v(x) ≤ 1). The directory covers specialized classes like rank-one valuations (codomain embeddable in ℝ≥0) and discrete valuations (with cyclic nontrivial value groups generated by uniformizers), including Serre's characterization of discrete valuation rings as principal ideal rings. Extensions, quotients, ramification groups, and connections to integral closedness round out the classical theory, while the ValuativeRel subdirectory provides an axiomatic preorder-based alternative that completely characterizes equivalence classes of valuations.
