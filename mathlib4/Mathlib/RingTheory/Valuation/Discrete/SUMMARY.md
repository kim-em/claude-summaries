# Discrete

## Overview

The `Discrete/` subdirectory contains the theory of rank-one discrete valuations on rings and fields. A valuation is discrete if its value group has a generator strictly less than 1, which is equivalent to the value group being cyclic and nontrivial. This includes the formalization of uniformizers (elements whose valuation is the generator), the equivalence between discrete valuation rings and valuation subrings with cyclic nontrivial value groups, and Serre's theorem that such valuation subrings are principal ideal rings.
