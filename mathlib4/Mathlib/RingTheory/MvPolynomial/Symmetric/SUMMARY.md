# Symmetric

## Overview

This directory develops the theory of symmetric polynomials in multivariate polynomial rings. It defines the key bases (elementary, complete homogeneous, power sum, monomial symmetric), proves the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials (that the symmetric subalgebra is freely generated by elementary symmetric polynomials), and establishes Newton's identities relating elementary symmetric polynomials to power sums. These results are foundational for algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, and Galois theory applications.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definitions: `IsSymmetric` predicate, `symmetricSubalgebra`, and four classical symmetric polynomial families: `esymm` (elementary), `hsymm` (complete homogeneous), `psum` (power sums), `msymm` (monomial symmetric). Also defines partition-indexed products (`esymmPart`, `hsymmPart`, `psumPart`). Includes symmetry proofs under renaming, support/degree computations for elementary symmetric polynomials. |
| FundamentalTheorem.lean | The Fundamental Theorem: `esymmAlgEquiv` shows the symmetric subalgebra of `MvPolynomial (Fin n) R` is isomorphic to `MvPolynomial (Fin n) R` via elementary symmetric polynomials. Uses lexicographic ordering on monomials and well-founded induction on `supDegree`. Key lemmas: `esymmAlgHom_injective`, `esymmAlgHom_surjective`, characterization via `Fin.accumulate`/`invAccumulate`. |
| NewtonIdentities.lean | Newton's identities: `mul_esymm_eq_sum` gives a recurrence for k·esymm(k) in terms of lower-degree esymm and psum. Dual form `psum_eq_mul_esymm_sub_sum` expresses psum(k) in terms of esymm. Uses Zeilberger's combinatorial proof via involution on pairs with canceling weights. Also proves `sum_antidiagonal_card_esymm_psum_eq_zero`. |
