# Adjoin

## Overview

The `Adjoin/` directory contains the theory of adjoining elements to rings and algebras to form subalgebras, which is fundamental to constructing field and ring extensions. This includes basic results on the `Algebra.adjoin` operation, finitely-generated subalgebras (the FG predicate), dimension theory for adjoined subalgebras, specialized results for fields and polynomials, power basis constructions, singleton adjunction, and tower laws for algebra extensions. The theory handles both single-element and multi-element adjunction, with applications to algebraic extensions, integral elements, and module finiteness.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core theory of `Algebra.adjoin` including product constructions, tower laws, restriction of scalars, and fundamental lemmas about subalgebras generated by sets |
| FG.lean | Finitely-generated (FG) subalgebras predicate; proves FG is preserved under products, maps, and suprema; includes Noetherian ring transfer results |
| Dimension.lean | Dimension bounds for subalgebras formed by supremum: proves `rank(A ⊔ B) ≤ rank(A) * rank(B)` for free subalgebras |
| FGBaseChange.lean | Shows elements of tensor products A ⊗[R] B lie in base changes of finitely-generated subalgebras |
| Field.lean | Field-specific adjoin results: equivalence F[a] ≃ₐ[F] F[x]/(minpoly), lifting embeddings when minimal polynomials split, bounds on adjoin rank |
| Polynomial.lean | Proves `adjoin R {X} = ⊤` for polynomial rings; establishes `Algebra.adjoin R {x}` as range of aeval; proves adjoin singleton is commutative |
| PowerBasis.lean | Constructs canonical power basis {1, x, ..., x^(d-1)} for K[x] where d = degree of minimal polynomial; integrality of basis element coordinates |
| Singleton.lean | Ring homomorphisms and equivalences between A[b] and A[↑b] (adjoin element vs adjoin its image); establishes scalar tower structure |
| Tower.lean | **Artin-Tate lemma** (fg_of_fg_of_fg): in tower C/B/A with A Noetherian, if C is algebra-finite over A and module-finite over B, then B is algebra-finite over A; transitivity of FG property |
