# GradedAlgebra

## Overview

The `GradedAlgebra/` directory provides comprehensive theory of graded rings and algebras, focusing on internally-graded structures where a ring or algebra decomposes as a direct sum of graded components. The core theory establishes graded algebra definitions with canonical decomposition isomorphisms `A ≃+* ⨁ i, 𝒜 i` and projection maps to graded components. Key results include finite type theorems showing graded rings of finite type are generated by homogeneous elements of positive degree; homogeneous localization theory constructing subrings where numerators and denominators share the same grading with local ring structure; Noetherian preservation from the graded ring to its degree-zero component; and homogeneous ideal theory with characterizations of prime and radical ideals. The `Homogeneous/` subdirectory develops the foundational theory of homogeneous elements, providing definitions and lattice structures for homogeneous ideals, submodules, and subsemirings, along with Galois connections between homogeneous cores and hulls, and the construction of the irrelevant ideal consisting of elements with zero degree-zero component.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core definitions of `GradedRing` and `GradedAlgebra` typeclasses for internally-graded structures; decomposition ring equivalence `A ≃+* ⨁ i, 𝒜 i`; projection maps to graded components |
| FiniteType.lean | Proves graded rings of finite type over degree-zero component are generated by homogeneous elements of positive degree |
| HomogeneousLocalization.lean | Constructs homogeneous localization `{a/b ∈ Aₓ \| ∃ i, a ∈ 𝒜ᵢ ∧ b ∈ 𝒜ᵢ}` as quotient of `NumDenSameDeg`; proves local ring structure when localizing at complement of prime; grading-preserving maps between localizations |
| Noetherian.lean | Shows degree-zero component `𝒜 0` of Noetherian graded ring is Noetherian |
| Radical.lean | Theory of homogeneous ideals and their radicals; proves homogeneous ideals are prime iff homogeneously prime; shows radical of homogeneous ideal is homogeneous |
