# GradedAlgebra

## Overview

The `GradedAlgebra/` directory provides the theory of graded rings and algebras, focusing on internally-graded structures where a ring or algebra decomposes as a direct sum of graded components. Core topics include basic graded algebra definitions and the canonical decomposition isomorphism; finite type results showing graded rings of finite type are generated by positive-degree homogeneous elements; homogeneous localization constructing subrings where numerators and denominators have the same grading; preservation of the Noetherian property by the degree-zero component; and homogeneous ideals with their prime and radical properties.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Basic.lean | Core definitions of `GradedRing` and `GradedAlgebra` typeclasses for internally-graded structures; decomposition ring equivalence `A ≃+* ⨁ i, 𝒜 i`; projection maps to graded components |
| FiniteType.lean | Proves graded rings of finite type over degree-zero component are generated by homogeneous elements of positive degree |
| HomogeneousLocalization.lean | Constructs homogeneous localization `{a/b ∈ Aₓ \| ∃ i, a ∈ 𝒜ᵢ ∧ b ∈ 𝒜ᵢ}` as quotient of `NumDenSameDeg`; proves local ring structure when localizing at complement of prime; grading-preserving maps between localizations |
| Noetherian.lean | Shows degree-zero component `𝒜 0` of Noetherian graded ring is Noetherian |
| Radical.lean | Theory of homogeneous ideals and their radicals; proves homogeneous ideals are prime iff homogeneously prime; shows radical of homogeneous ideal is homogeneous |
