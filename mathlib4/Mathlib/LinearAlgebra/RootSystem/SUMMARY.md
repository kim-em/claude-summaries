# RootSystem

## Overview

The `RootSystem/` directory contains a comprehensive formalization of root pairings, root data, and root systems from Lie theory. Root pairings provide a general framework unifying root systems and root data, built on perfectly-paired modules with indexed families of roots, coroots, and reflection permutations. The theory includes both abstract foundations (definitions, morphisms, homological properties) and concrete structures (bases, Weyl groups, Cartan matrices), covering both finite and infinite root systems with particular attention to crystallographic (integer-valued) cases. The finite subdirectory establishes canonical bilinear forms with positive-definiteness results, Coxeter weight bounds, and complete classification of the exceptional 𝔤₂ root system. The GeckConstruction subdirectory implements a matrix-based construction of semisimple Lie algebras from reduced crystallographic root systems, proving irreducibility and triviality of the radical. Together, this provides a complete formalization spanning abstract root theory through concrete Lie algebra constructions.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Defs.lean | Core definitions: RootPairing (perfectly-paired modules with roots, coroots, and reflection permutations satisfying compatibility axioms), RootDatum (root pairing with finitely-generated free Abelian groups), RootSystem (root pairing where roots span ambient module), with design choices for indexing types and explicit reflection permutations |
| Basic.lean | Fundamental results: RootPairing.ext (uniqueness of root-coroot correspondence in characteristic zero without torsion), RootSystem.ext (root system determined by roots alone), RootPairing.mk' and RootSystem.mk' (simplified constructors requiring only reflection stability for finite families) |
| Base.lean | Base theory for root pairings: RootSystem.Base definition with linear independence axioms for both roots and coroots, positivity predicate (IsPos) relative to bases, induction principles (induction_add for adding simple roots, induction_reflect for reflection), more restrictive than classical definition for non-reduced systems |
| BaseExists.lean | Base existence theorems: RootPairing.Base.mk' (alternate constructor requiring axioms only for roots), RootPairing.nonempty_base (existence proof for reduced crystallographic root systems), using ordered coefficients approach with dual coefficient sets |
| Hom.lean | Morphisms of root pairings following SGA III: Hom (linear maps on weight/coweight spaces with index bijection), composition and identity, End/Aut structures, Equiv (isomorphisms with weightEquiv/coweightEquiv), reflection automorphisms, homomorphisms to linear automorphism groups (weightHom, coweightHom) |
| WeylGroup.lean | Weyl group as subgroup of automorphisms generated by reflections: weylGroup definition, permutation representation (weylGroupToPerm) on root indices, weight space representation (weightHom to linear reflections), coweight space representation (coweightHom to coreflections), with range characterization theorems |
| CartanMatrix.lean | Cartan matrices for crystallographic root pairings: cartanMatrix definition with respect to base, nondegeneracy theorem, induction principle from Dynkin diagram connectedness, equivOfCartanMatrixEq (root system determined by Cartan matrix) |
| Chain.lean | Root chain/string theory: chainTopCoeff and chainBotCoeff (natural numbers p, q for chain β - q•α, ..., β + p•α), root_add_zsmul_mem_range_iff (chains are unbroken intervals), chainBotCoeff_add_chainTopCoeff_le (chains have length ≤ 3), for linearly independent roots in finite crystallographic pairings |
| Reduced.lean | Reduced root pairings: IsReduced (linearly dependent roots related by sign), linearIndependent_iff_coxeterWeight_ne_four (two roots independent iff Coxeter weight ≠ 4), with versions for pairings valued in smaller rings (IsValuedIn) |
| Irreducible.lean | Irreducible root pairings: invtRootSubmodule (invariant submodules under reflections), isSimpleModule_weylGroupRootRep_iff (criterion for Weyl group representation on root space to be irreducible), IsIrreducible typeclass with alternative constructor for field coefficients |
| IsValuedIn.lean | Root pairings valued in subrings: IsValuedIn typeclass (pairing takes values in S ⊆ R via algebraMap), IsCrystallographic (integer-valued pairings), pairingIn (S-valued pairing function), coxeterWeightIn (product of pairings), main application to crystallographic systems over ℤ |
| OfBilinear.lean | Root pairings from bilinear forms: IsReflective (vector with regular norm where norm divides 2•inner products), coroot construction, RootPairing.of_Bilinear (root pairing from reflective vectors in reflexive modules), generalizes classical construction from integral lattices |
| RootPositive.lean | Positive roots relative to bases and their properties |
| RootPairingCat.lean | Category theory: RootPairingCat objects (root pairings with weight/coweight spaces and index set), category structure with Hom morphisms, identity and composition, following SGA III Exp. 21 Section 6 |
| BaseChange.lean | Base change operations for root pairings, allowing coefficient ring changes |
