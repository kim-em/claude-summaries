# Lex

## Overview

The `Lex/` directory contains theory for order homomorphisms on lexicographic products. In a lexicographic product `α ×ₗ β`, pairs are ordered first by their first component, and only when first components are equal does the second component determine the order. This directory provides the infrastructure for working with order-preserving functions on such structures.
