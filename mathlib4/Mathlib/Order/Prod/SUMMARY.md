# Prod

## Overview

The `Prod/` directory serves as an organizational container for product order structures. Product orders equip the Cartesian product of two ordered types with an order structure, typically the pointwise order where `(a₁, b₁) ≤ (a₂, b₂)` iff `a₁ ≤ a₂` and `b₁ ≤ b₂`. This directory currently contains only the `Lex/` subdirectory for lexicographic variants of product orders.
