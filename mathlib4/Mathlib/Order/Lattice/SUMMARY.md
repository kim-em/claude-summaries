# Lattice

## Overview

The `Order/Lattice/` subdirectory contains specialized theory for lattice congruences. This is a focused directory with a single file defining congruence relations on lattices, which are equivalence relations compatible with the lattice operations (inf and sup). The theory includes alternative characterizations of lattice congruences and constructs kernels of lattice homomorphisms as congruences.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Congruence.lean | Lattice congruence relations: LatticeCon structure (equivalence relation compatible with ⊓ and ⊔), alternative constructor mk' with simplified conditions, LatticeCon.ker (kernel of lattice homomorphism as congruence); based on Grätzer's "General lattice theory" |
