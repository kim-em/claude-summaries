# summaries

## Overview

This is the output directory for the claude-summary tool, containing progressively generated SUMMARY.md files for multiple source repositories. Each subdirectory mirrors the structure of a different source repository being summarized, with metadata-enriched markdown files capturing folder contents, file purposes, and search tags. The summaries enable incremental indexing of large codebases across multiple Claude sessions with freshness tracking via git SHA and timestamps.
