## Overview

VS Code family keybindings configuration, shared across VS Code, Cursor, and Antigravity editors via symlinks. This directory contains a single keybindings.json file that overrides default keyboard shortcuts with custom bindings for Claude Code integration and terminal functionality. The file is symlinked to the keybindings location for each editor as managed by `~/bin/setup-machine`.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `keybindings.json` | Custom keybindings for Claude Code terminal (cmd+shift+2), composer mode (cmd+i), and terminal line continuation (shift+enter for backslash-newline) |

## Subdirectories
