## Overview

Comprehensive vehicle ownership documentation spanning two countries and three vehicles, chronicling Scott Morrison and Katie Liesinger's automotive history from California (2009-2012) through Australian Capital Territory (2012-2019). The California period (CA subdirectory) documents a problematic 1999 Toyota Corolla ownership ending with an insurance denial, a learner's permit, and FasTrak account closure upon relocation. The primary Australian vehicle was a 2010 Subaru Outback 2.5i Premium AWD (YHE86K) purchased from Pickles Auctions in 2012 for $24,600.50, with complete documentation from original Telstra Fleet delivery through final service at 175,199 km in March 2019, including service records from Capital Subaru Fyshwick and Haig Park Service Centre, ACT registration renewals, three Victorian speeding tickets, NRMA CTP insurance, airbag recall service, and two years of Comminsure comprehensive insurance policies. Additionally, the folder documents a Resort Goods 7×4 commercial duty trailer purchased in 2018 for $2,680 and registered in ACT (T8031F) with joint ownership. The collection provides a complete record of vehicle ownership, maintenance practices, insurance history, and traffic violations across two continents.
