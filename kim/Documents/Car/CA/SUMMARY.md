## Overview

California vehicle and administrative documentation from 2009-2012. This folder chronicles a problematic vehicle incident: a 1999 Toyota Corolla requiring repair after a February 2010 loss event, an associated insurance claim denial due to no active coverage, and eventual California exit indicated by FasTrak account closure in September 2012. The DMV subdirectory contains a learner's permit for Scott Edward Morrison from 2009. The documents suggest a vehicle ownership period in Berkeley, CA that ended with relocation to Cedar, Minnesota.
