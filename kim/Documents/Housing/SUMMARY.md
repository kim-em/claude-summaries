# Housing

## Overview

Complete housing history archive documenting Scott Morrison and Katie Liesinger's residential journey from US graduate student rentals (2004-2012) through Australia relocation to Canberra homeownership (2012-2021). The collection traces a clear progression: Oakland/Berkeley student housing (2004-2009), compressed Canberra rental search during USA-to-Australia relocation (July 2012), interim ANU student accommodation, successful securing of 22/7 Ijong St Braddon lease, and culminating in the January 2014 purchase of 18 Lambert Street, Lyneham ACT 2602. The property ownership documentation is comprehensive, covering the complete mortgage lifecycle from initial BankWest application ($559,450 at 4.84%, including sophisticated Mathematica modeling of tiered mortgages with family loans from Adele Morrison $215k and Pam Morrison $150k) through 2017 Macquarie Bank refinancing ($491,200 at 3.74%) to Bankwest discharge, alongside systematic utility management, ACT rates tracking property appreciation ($464k→$595k), home insurance, kitchen renovation, and SketchUp space planning. This archive represents both a financial chronicle of a major life asset and a geographic record of academic mobility from US PhD student to Australian permanent establishment.
