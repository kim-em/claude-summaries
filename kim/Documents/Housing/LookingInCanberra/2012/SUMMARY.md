## Overview

Comprehensive documentation of Scott Morrison and Katie Liesinger's rental property search during their relocation from Berkeley, California to Canberra, Australia in mid-2012. The folder captures both the financial transition between countries and a systematic housing search across inner north Canberra suburbs. Financial records show the cross-country move: a final Bank of America statement (May-June 2012) with $21,768.14 balance from their 2312 Parker Street Berkeley address, and Commonwealth Bank NetBank summary (July 3, 2012) showing newly opened Australian accounts totaling $17,999.28 AUD. Between July 2-7, 2012, they submitted six rental applications for properties ranging from $530-590/week: 22/7 Ijong Street Braddon (signed July 7), 24 Dutton Street Dickson ($575/week), 14/64 Wattle Street Lyneham ($590/week, signed July 6), 16B Towns Crescent O'Connor (signed July 4), 29 Hannan Crescent Ainslie ($550/week, signed July 2), and 3 Macarthur Avenue O'Connor ($530/week, signed July 7). All applications document Scott's new position as ANU ARC Fellow at $134,601pa starting June 30, 2012, their previous Berkeley tenancy (May 2009-June 2012 at $1,300 USD/month with landlord Alan Curtis), and the household composition of two adults and two young children (Simon aged 2, Ruth aged 0-2 months).
