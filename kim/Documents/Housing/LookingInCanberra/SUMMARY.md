# LookingInCanberra

## Overview

Complete housing journey documentation spanning Scott Morrison and Katie Liesinger's relocation from Berkeley, California to Canberra and their establishment as Australian property owners. The 2012 materials capture the immediate post-arrival rental search during a compressed five-day period (July 2-7, 2012), with six systematically prepared applications for inner north properties ranging from $530-590/week, supported by comprehensive financial transition documentation showing the closure of US banking ($21,768.14 final Bank of America balance) and establishment of Australian accounts ($17,999.28 AUD at Commonwealth Bank). All applications consistently documented Scott's new appointment as ANU ARC Fellow ($134,601pa starting June 30), their excellent rental history at 2312 Parker Street Berkeley (2009-2012, landlord Alan Curtis), and their young family (Simon age 2, Ruth age 0-2 months). The search resulted in securing 22/7 Ijong Street Braddon. Two years later, the 2014 materials document their purchase of 18 Lambert Street, Lyneham, marking their permanent establishment in Canberra with the transition from rental tenancy to home ownership.
