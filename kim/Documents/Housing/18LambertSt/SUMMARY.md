## Overview

Comprehensive property ownership archive for 18 Lambert Street, Lyneham ACT 2602, documenting the complete lifecycle of primary residence ownership from 2014-2021. The property was purchased on 28 May 2014 for $715,000 (with $71,500 deposit) by Scott Morrison and Katie Liesinger, financed through a combination of Bankwest mortgage ($559,450 initial approval), family loans (Adele Morrison: $215,000 at 3.71% interest; Pam Morrison: $150,000 interest-free), and owner funds. The archive tracks: (1) complete mortgage history through Bankwest (2014-2017) including multiple interest rate adjustments and eventual refinancing via Mortgage Choice to exit with $484k payoff; (2) systematic utility billing records spanning 2014-2019 from ActewAGL electricity/gas and Icon Water, with later transition to Origin Energy in 2021; (3) ACT government rates notices showing property valuation growth from $464k (2015) to $595k (2020) with COVID-19 relief documentation; (4) SketchUp models for space planning created in 2023; (5) AAMI home insurance, kitchen renovation documentation, and creative projects like Mathematica-based treehouse planning using trilateration. The collection provides a complete audit trail of residential property ownership, financing, maintenance, and lifecycle management in the Australian Capital Territory.
