## Overview

Complete mortgage documentation for 18 Lambert Street covering the Bankwest Premium Select Home Loan lifecycle from 2014-2017. The folder chronicles the loan's evolution through three phases: initial establishment (February 2014 conditional approval for $559,450 with 360-month term via Mortgage Choice broker John Osborne), active management including a March 2015 exploration of fixed interest rate options with comprehensive documentation of proposed variable-to-fixed rate conversion (contained in the fix-interest-rate subdirectory), followed by multiple interest rate adjustments in response to market conditions (November 2015: 4.42%→4.60%, May 2016: 4.60%→4.40%, August 2016: 4.40%→4.30%, April 2017: 4.30%→4.37%), and final refinance exit (August 2017 refinance through Mortgage Choice Home Loans resulting in Bankwest discharge with final payoff $484,046.52 plus $338.20 bank fees). The documentation provides a complete audit trail of loan management decisions, rate changes, and the refinancing process that ultimately moved the borrowers to a new lender.
