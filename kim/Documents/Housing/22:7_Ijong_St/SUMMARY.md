## Overview

Complete rental tenancy archive for Unit 22/7 Ijong Street, Braddon ACT 2612 (unit name "Devonport"), covering the full lifecycle of Scott Morrison and Katie Liesinger's tenancy from July 2012 through February 2013. The 3-bedroom townhouse was rented from landlord Mark Milner at $600/week ($603.20 after increase) with a $2,400 bond. This comprehensive collection documents the entire rental experience: initial lease agreement and bond lodgement, detailed move-in condition report noting pre-existing issues (wonky dishwasher buttons, broken security system, neighbor's doorbell chiming in house), ongoing property maintenance and repairs (oven work, electrical safety upgrades including RCD replacement), utility setup and billing, and infrastructure improvements during occupancy (EveryNet service, NBN rollout planning in 2014). The ACTAGLEW subdirectory contains a complete timeline of electricity billing from account setup through final disconnection, showing the service lifecycle as the property changed occupancy. Together, these records paint a detailed picture of a short-term Canberra rental during 2012-2013.
