# _20160212-push-button-game

## Overview

Two-player competitive Arduino game where players try to match the color of an RGB LED by pressing their team's button at the right time. The RGB LED starts red, and players alternate pressing red or blue buttons to flip the LED color and light up their team's LED strips. Uses simple state tracking with boolean flags to enforce turn-taking - red team can only score when LED is red, blue team when LED is blue.
