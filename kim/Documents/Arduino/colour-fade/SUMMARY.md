# colour-fade

## Overview

SparkFun Inventor's Kit example sketch demonstrating RGB LED color control and smooth color transitions. The sketch has been customized from the original tutorial code to cycle through specific colors (cyan → chartreuse → dark violet → crimson) using linear interpolation for smooth fading. Includes both the original tutorial functions for basic 8-color display and spectrum cycling, though these are commented out in favor of the custom fade sequence.
