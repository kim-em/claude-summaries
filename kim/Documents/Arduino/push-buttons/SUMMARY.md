# push-buttons

## Overview

Educational Arduino project demonstrating digital input handling with dual push-button control. Contains a single sketch (`sketch_feb11a`) that implements a toggle mechanism where two independent pushbuttons (pins 2 and 3) control a single LED (pin 13). The implementation focuses on proper edge detection using state tracking to identify falling edges (button press events), preventing continuous triggering while buttons are held down. Created February 2016, this project serves as a foundational exercise in button debouncing concepts and state change detection, essential skills for interactive Arduino projects.
