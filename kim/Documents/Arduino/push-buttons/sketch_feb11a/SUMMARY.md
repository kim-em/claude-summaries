# sketch_feb11a

## Overview

Arduino sketch implementing a dual-button LED toggle with edge detection. Two pushbuttons (pins 2 and 3) independently control a single LED (pin 13) - pressing either button toggles the LED state. Uses state tracking to detect falling edges (button press events) by comparing current readings with previous states, preventing continuous triggering while buttons are held down. Created February 2016 as an educational exercise in digital input handling and button state management.
