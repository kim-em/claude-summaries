## Overview

Historical archive of CV materials from Kim Morrison's early academic career (1998-2008), including a research statement from the 2008 Miller Fellowship application, an early teaching statement from the postdoc period, UNSW undergraduate academic transcripts from the BSc Honours program (1998-2001), and UNSW prize certificates. These documents capture the early trajectory from undergraduate mathematics at UNSW (achieving University Medal) through PhD work at Berkeley to postdoctoral positions at Station Q and Berkeley, focusing on research areas including Khovanov homology, blob homology, fusion categories, planar algebras, and quantum group representation theory.
