## Overview

Media coverage articles documenting Kim Morrison's mathematical research and public engagement, primarily from 2013. The collection focuses heavily on the Polymath 8 project's collaborative effort to improve bounds on prime gaps following Yitang Zhang's breakthrough, featuring Morrison's pivotal May 2013 blog post that sparked the online collaboration. Also includes extensive coverage of Morrison's advocacy for traditional blackboards at ANU's new Mathematical Sciences Institute, reflecting the cultural practices of mathematical collaboration.
