# diagrams

## Overview

Complete mathematical diagram asset pipeline for CV and academic documents, providing both the diagrams themselves and the build infrastructure to maintain them. The core assets are Temperley-Lieb algebra diagrams (five in the TL-2-4 series) and basic knot diagram primitives (crossing, horizontal caps, vertical caps), maintained in both EPS and PDF formats for LaTeX compatibility. The build system provides bidirectional conversion (PDF ↔ EPS via Ghostscript at 2400 DPI), dependency detection by parsing LaTeX sources for diagram references, and incremental rebuilds based on timestamp staleness. Additionally includes a specialized latex2pdf workflow for converting arbitrary LaTeX mathematics to defontified PostScript at 9600 DPI, enabling import of mathematical notation into Illustrator as editable vector paths without font dependencies.

## Key Files

No files in the root directory - all content organized in subdirectories.

## Subdirectories

- [x] `eps/` - Encapsulated PostScript versions of eight diagrams (five TL-2-4 series Temperley-Lieb diagrams plus three primitives: crossing, horizontal, vertical) generated by Ghostscript, designed for LaTeX inclusion as source vector files
- [x] `pdf/` - PDF versions of the eight diagrams plus signature.jpg handwritten signature image, serving as output format for LaTeX documents and input for EPS conversion via scripts
- [x] `latex2pdf/` - Specialized workflow for converting LaTeX mathematics to Illustrator-editable vectors: includes defontify.tex template, defontify.bat compilation script (latex → dvips → ps2pdf → gs), and nofonts.ps example output with characters converted to vector paths at 9600 DPI
- [x] `scripts/` - Build automation for diagram pipeline: find_all_diagrams.sh scans LaTeX sources for diagram references, stripall.sh performs incremental PDF-to-EPS conversion using Ghostscript at 2400 DPI with timestamp-based staleness checks and metadata stripping for reproducible builds
