# sections

## Overview

Modular LaTeX section files intended for inclusion in the main CV documents. Contains the comprehensive publications list covering Kim Morrison's academic output from 2006-2023 in subfactor theory, fusion categories, topological quantum computing, Khovanov homology, and 4-manifold invariants, plus a climbing achievements section documenting significant alpine and big wall climbing accomplishments. These sections are included by the main CV documents via `\input{}` commands, enabling modular composition and reuse across different CV variants.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `publications.tex` | Comprehensive publications list (13KB) with highlighted publications section featuring 7 major research outputs (including PNAS blob complex paper, Acta Mathematica extended Haagerup construction, Geometry & Topology 4-manifold invariants from Khovanov-Rozansky homology, and smooth 4D Poincaré conjecture paper with Freedman/Gompf/Walker) followed by 40+ other publications spanning 2006-2023, with arXiv links, DOI references, and Australian ERA journal rankings |
| `climbing.tex` | Personal climbing achievements section documenting alpine and big wall climbs including Palisades and Evolution traverses, Salathe Wall and The Nose of El Capitan (one-day ascent in 18.5 hours with Yossi Farjoun), Bugaboos, Timewave Zero at El Potrero Chico, and Ferrari Route on Alpamayo Peru |
