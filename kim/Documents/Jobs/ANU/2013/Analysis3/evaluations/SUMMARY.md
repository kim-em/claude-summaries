## Overview

Student Evaluation of Learning and Teaching (SELT) reports from Semester 2, 2013 for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours. Contains both course-level and instructor-level evaluations from the EvaSys system. Response rate was 50% (5 responses from 10 enrolled students). Overall ratings were strong with course satisfaction averaging 4.2/5 and instructor satisfaction 4.0/5, with particularly high marks for feedback (4.6/5), student engagement (4.4/5), and access to learning materials (4.8/5). Main constructive feedback indicated lectures moved too quickly and would benefit from slower pacing and more board work rather than PDF slides.
