# probs:assts

## Overview

Complete collection of problem sets, graded assignments, and solutions from Andrew Mathas's 2012 offering of MATH3325 Analysis 3. Contains 5 problem sets for tutorial discussion (prob01-05), 4 graded assignments plus final exam (ass1-4, ass.final) with LaTeX source and PDFs, sample solutions for Assignment 2, class notes from September 11, and a supplementary PDF on Lidskii's theorem. Problems are primarily drawn from Stein and Shakarchi's Real Analysis textbook and cover core functional analysis topics: Hilbert spaces, bounded linear transformations, orthogonal projections, compact operators, operator norms, strong convergence, integral operators with singular kernels, and the completeness of operator spaces.
