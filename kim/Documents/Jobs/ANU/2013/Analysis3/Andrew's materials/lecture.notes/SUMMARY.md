# lecture.notes

## Overview

Complete set of 10 lecture note chapters for Andrew Mathas's 2012 offering of MATH3325 Analysis 3, covering the full functional analysis syllabus. Each lecture is provided in LaTeX source (.tex) with two PDF variants: standard and reduced (".r.pdf" versions, likely 2x2 pages per sheet for printing). Topics progress from foundational Hilbert space theory through compact operators, Fourier transforms, partial differential equations (fundamental solutions and Dirichlet problem), measure theory (including Hausdorff measure and fractals), Banach spaces, and culminate in Fredholm operator theory. All lecture notes use a consistent template with custom macros for mathematical notation and large font size (20pt) for lecture projection.
