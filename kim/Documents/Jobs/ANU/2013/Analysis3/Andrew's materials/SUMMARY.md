# Andrew's materials

## Overview

Complete archive of teaching materials from Andrew Mathas's 2012 offering of MATH3325 Analysis 3, serving as reference for the 2013 course offering. This comprehensive collection includes: (1) 10 lecture note chapters with LaTeX sources and dual PDF formats (standard and reduced 2x2 for printing) covering the full functional analysis syllabus from Hilbert spaces through Fredholm theory; (2) 5 tutorial problem sets plus 4 graded assignments, final exam, and worked solutions; (3) complete course administration materials including syllabus, assessment structure (4 assignments 10% each, essay 15%, attendance 5%, exam 40%), essay topic guidelines, and historical grade data from 2008 and 2011 offerings. The course followed Stein & Shakarchi's Real Analysis Vol. III as primary text and covered: Hilbert spaces, compact operators, spectral theory, Fourier transforms, fundamental solutions to PDEs, Dirichlet problems, Lebesgue and Hausdorff measure theory, fractals, Banach spaces (including Hahn-Banach theorem and functional analysis principles), and Fredholm operator theory.
