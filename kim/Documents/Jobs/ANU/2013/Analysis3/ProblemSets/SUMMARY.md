# ProblemSets

## Overview

Four problem sets for MATH3325 Analysis 3 (2013), designed for discussion in weekly tutorials. Each problem set includes LaTeX source, compiled PDF, and hints/solutions PDF. Topics progress from Hilbert space fundamentals (closed subspaces, projections, bounded linear transformations) through Lp spaces and Fourier analysis to measure theory and Banach spaces, mirroring the lecture sequence. Problem sets were scheduled for specific tutorial dates between late July and mid-October 2013.
