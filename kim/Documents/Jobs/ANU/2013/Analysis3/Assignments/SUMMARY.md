# Assignments

## Overview

Complete assessment archive for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course (Semester 2, 2013), documenting both instructor materials and student work across four assignments, essay component, and final examination. The assessment structure reveals declining submission rates (Assignment 1: 13 students, Assignment 2: 1 student, Assignment 4: 10 students) and comprehensive coverage of functional analysis topics from Hilbert spaces to spectral theory. Essay component (required 5-8 pages) included draft feedback cycle with extensive instructor annotations before final submissions on topics like fixed point theorems, Peter-Weyl theorem, and fractal dimension. Contains all problem sheets (TeX sources and PDFs), sample solutions, 50+ student submissions totaling hundreds of megabytes, and documentation of the pedagogical process from assignment design through grading and feedback.

## Subdirectories

- [x] `Assignment1Submissions/` - 13 student submissions on Hilbert space operators, strong convergence, orthogonal projections, and integral operators (due August 16). Mix of file sizes (70KB-1.2MB) reflecting varying solution lengths and formatting. All submissions include formal proofs following assignment's 4-question structure
- [x] `Assignment2Submissions/` - Single submission from Johannes Kirschner (u5404797, ETH Zürich exchange student) on Fourier transforms, L^p convergence, and convolution theory. Notably sparse participation compared to Assignment 1's 13 submissions
- [x] `Assignment4Submissions/` - 10 submissions (due November 1) on spectral theory, self-adjoint/unitary operators, Cayley transform, functional calculus, and weak topology. Mix of handwritten scanned PDFs and typeset LaTeX solutions, including work from exchange student Johannes Kirschner
- [x] `EssayDrafts/` - 13 scanned draft submissions (October 2013) with extensive handwritten instructor feedback on fixed point theorems, game theory applications, Hausdorff measure, and fractal geometry. Files range 743KB-10.1MB showing detailed annotation process. Demonstrates iterative feedback cycle before final submission
- [x] `EssayExamples/` - 4 exemplary essays from previous course offerings (2009-2013) provided as writing models: Tom Phelan on trace class operators/Lidskii's theorem, Ben Lim on Peter-Weyl theorem, Yitao Lei on Bochner's theorem, Hannah Keese on fixed point theorems. Demonstrates expected quality and exposition style
- [x] `FinalEssays/` - 13 final essay submissions covering fixed point theorems (Brouwer, Kakutani, Markov-Kakutani), Nash equilibria, Peter-Weyl theorem, fractal dimension, and complemented subspaces in Banach spaces. Essays demonstrate mastery of advanced topics beyond core curriculum (189KB-5.6MB)
- [x] `FinalExams/` - 6 scanned exam booklets (1.9-6.3MB, 8-13 pages) with handwritten solutions on Lebesgue measure, Lp spaces, spectral theory, compact operators, self-adjoint operators, and Banach spaces. Visible grading (e.g., u5034323: 48/100, u5025630: 73/100) shows assessment of student mastery
