# Assignment2Submissions

## Overview

Single student submission for Assignment 2 from Johannes Kirschner (u5404797, exchange student from ETH Zürich), submitted September 2, 2013. Notably, the PDF is labeled "Assignment 1" despite being in the Assignment2Submissions folder, suggesting possible mislabeling or resubmission. The 7-page document contains detailed mathematical proofs on functional analysis topics including Fourier transform properties, L^p space convergence, convolution identities, and density properties of function spaces.
