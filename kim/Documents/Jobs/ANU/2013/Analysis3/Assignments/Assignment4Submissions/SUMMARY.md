# Assignment4Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for Assignment 4 of MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course (due November 1, 2013). Contains 10 PDF submissions from students tackling problems on spectral theory, bounded self-adjoint operators, unitary operators, positive operators, functional calculus, and weak topology/compactness. Mix of handwritten and typeset solutions, including work from exchange student Johannes Kirschner (ETH Zurich). Assignment covered advanced topics including Cayley transform, spectral mapping theorem, invariant subspaces, and applications of Egorov's theorem.
