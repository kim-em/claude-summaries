# FinalEssays

## Overview

Final essay submissions from students in MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2013). Students were required to write 5-8 page essays on advanced analysis topics, demonstrating mastery of functional analysis concepts beyond the core course material. Essays cover diverse topics including fixed point theorems (Brouwer, Kakutani, Markov-Kakutani), applications to game theory and Nash equilibria, Peter-Weyl theorem for compact groups, fractal dimension and self-similarity, and complemented/uncomplemented subspaces in Banach spaces. All submissions are in PDF format, ranging from 189KB to 5.6MB.
