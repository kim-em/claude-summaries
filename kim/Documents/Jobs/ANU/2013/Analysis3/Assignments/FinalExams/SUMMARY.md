# FinalExams

## Overview

Student final exam submissions for MATH 3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2013). Six scanned exam booklets (1.9-6.3MB each, 8-13 pages) containing handwritten solutions to problems on functional analysis topics including Lebesgue measure, Lp spaces, spectral theory, compact operators, self-adjoint operators, and Banach spaces. Student IDs visible on exam booklets: u5034323 (48/100), u5025630 (73/100). Submissions show varying levels of completeness with instructor grading marks and scores circled on individual problems.
