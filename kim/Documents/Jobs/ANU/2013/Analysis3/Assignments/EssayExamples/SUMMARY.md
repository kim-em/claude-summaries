# EssayExamples

## Overview

Collection of four exemplary student essays from previous offerings of MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (2009-2013), provided to current students as models of expected quality and style for the essay component of the course. Essays demonstrate sophisticated mathematical exposition on advanced topics in functional analysis and operator theory, including trace class operators, representation theory, Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, and fixed point theorems.
