# Assignment1Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for Assignment 1 of MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course (Semester 2, 2013, due August 16). Contains 13 PDF submissions from students working on functional analysis problems covering bounded linear transformations on Hilbert spaces, strong operator convergence, orthogonal projections, and integral operators with weakly singular kernels. All submissions include student names and university IDs, with formal mathematical proofs following the assignment's 4-question structure on operators, compactness, projections, and Schur's test applications.
