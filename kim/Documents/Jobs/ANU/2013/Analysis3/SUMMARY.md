# Analysis3

## Overview

Complete archive of MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course materials from Semester 2, 2013 at ANU, documenting both the course design and student learning outcomes. This functional analysis course covered the progression from Hilbert space theory through abstract measure theory to spectral theory and Banach spaces, following Stein & Shakarchi's Real Analysis (Vol. III) as the primary text with supplementary references from Conway, Halmos, Helmberg, and Pedersen.

The course enrolled 14 students (13 completed) and featured: (1) **14 comprehensive lectures** (0-13) developing functional calculus, Hilbert spaces, compact operators, Fourier transforms, measure and integration theory, Radon-Nikodym derivatives, spectral theory, Banach spaces, and Fredholm theory; (2) **Rigorous assessment structure** comprising four assignments (declining submission rates: 13→1→10 students), essay component (5-8 pages with draft feedback cycle), and final examination, with all problem sheets, sample solutions, and 50+ student submissions preserved; (3) **Tutorial support** via four problem sets covering Hilbert spaces, Lp spaces, Fourier analysis, and Banach spaces; (4) **Learning outcomes documented** through exemplar assessments across all grade bands (Pass through High Distinction) and student evaluations (50% response rate, 4.2/5 course satisfaction, 4.0/5 instructor satisfaction).

Notably includes Andrew Mathas's complete 2012 teaching materials as reference (lecture notes, assignments, organizational documents), build automation for XeLaTeX compilation and SVN publication, TODO list identifying needed proof improvements (Carathéodory extension, Stone-Weierstrass, Borel calculus), and evidence of the pedagogical process from assignment design through grading and student feedback. Student evaluations highlighted excellent feedback and materials quality while suggesting slower lecture pacing and more board work over PDF slides.
