# Analysis3

## Overview

Complete teaching materials for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course taught in Semester 2, 2013 at ANU. The course focused on functional analysis, measure theory, and spectral theory using Stein & Shakarchi's Real Analysis (Vol. III) as the primary text. Includes comprehensive lecture notes on Hilbert spaces, operators, measure theory, and Banach spaces; four assignments with sample solutions; problem sets with hints; student grades (14 students enrolled, 13 completed); student evaluations; reference library; build scripts for publishing materials to course website. Materials also include Andrew Mathas's previous teaching materials and TODO list for lecture note improvements.
