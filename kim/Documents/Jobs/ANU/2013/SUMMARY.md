## Overview

Second year of employment at ANU (2013), containing annual report, teaching materials for MATH3325 (Analysis 3) course taught during DECRA fellowship, and outreach activities. The annual report documents extensive international travel (Vietnam, USA including Bodega Bay and Maui, Australia), research collaborations on subfactors and Khovanov homology with researchers at Vanderbilt, Northwestern, Kyoto, Microsoft Station Q, and others, supervision of Joshua Chen (Honours), Sebastian Mueller (reading course), and Narjess Afzaly (PhD committee), and MathOverflow moderation. Media coverage in Quanta Magazine, New Scientist, and ANU Reporter. Includes materials for Maths Day competition with 10 challenging problems covering algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory.
