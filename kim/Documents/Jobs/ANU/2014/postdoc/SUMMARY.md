# postdoc

## Overview

This folder contains the complete application pool for an ANU (Australian National University) postdoctoral fellowship position in mathematics from 2014. The Applications subfolder holds 66 PDF files (plus one Word document) representing submissions from 25 candidates across diverse mathematical specialties including topology, geometry, representation theory, algebraic topology, quantum topology, contact and symplectic geometry, and operator algebras. Applications follow a standardized naming convention (LASTNAME_APPLICATIONID_SUFFIX.pdf) where suffixes indicate document type: C (cover letter/selection criteria), R (resume/CV), and E (additional materials such as research statements). Notable candidates include researchers from major institutions working in quantum topology (Chirvasitu, Dancso), differential geometry (Golovko, PhD USC 2009), and chromatic stable homotopy theory (Heard, University of Melbourne). One applicant (Yang) submitted two separate applications with different IDs. The folder also contains a zip archive of all applications as of February 10, 2014.

## Subdirectories

- [x] `Applications/` - Contains 66 application documents from 25 candidates with diverse mathematical specialties (topology, geometry, representation theory, algebraic topology, quantum topology, contact/symplectic geometry, operator algebras). Files follow naming pattern LASTNAME_APPLICATIONID_SUFFIX.pdf where suffix is C (cover letter/selection criteria), R (resume/CV), or E (additional research materials). Notable submissions include one Word document (Zhang's cover letter) and one duplicate applicant (Yang with two different application IDs). File sizes range from small cover letters to substantial research portfolios (up to 643KB)
