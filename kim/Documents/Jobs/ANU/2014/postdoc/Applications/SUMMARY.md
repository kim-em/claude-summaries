# Applications

## Overview

This folder contains the complete set of application materials from 25 candidates for an ANU postdoctoral fellowship position in mathematics (2014). Each applicant submitted multiple PDF documents following a standardized naming convention: LASTNAME_APPLICATIONID_SUFFIX.pdf, where the suffix indicates document type: C (cover letter or selection criteria statement), R (resume/CV), and E (additional materials such as research statements, teaching statements, or publication samples). The applications span various mathematical specialties including topology, geometry, representation theory, and operator algebras.
