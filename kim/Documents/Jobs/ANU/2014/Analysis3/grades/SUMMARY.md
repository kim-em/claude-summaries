## Overview

Grade calculation and tracking materials for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course (Semester 2, 2014). Contains two official grade spreadsheets from ANU (one for undergrads MATH-3325-7322, one for the related MATH-6214-7325 course) and a Mathematica notebook that performs statistical analysis on the grade distributions. The notebook includes raw assignment scores for 15 students across 10 graded components (totaling 140 points possible), performs singular value decomposition on the grade matrix, generates visualizations of student performance distributions and per-question difficulty, and calculates correlation matrices to identify patterns in student performance across different assessment components.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `2460-MATH-3325-7322.xlsx` | Official ANU grade spreadsheet for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (course code 2460-MATH-3325-7322, 51KB Excel file) |
| `2460-MATH-6214-7325.xlsx` | Official ANU grade spreadsheet for the related course MATH-6214-7325 (course code 2460-MATH-6214-7325, 31KB Excel file) |
| `grades.nb` | Mathematica notebook (46KB) performing statistical analysis on student grades: stores raw scores for 15 students (identified by student ID numbers 3979034-5633502) across 10 assessment components with maximums {12,8,10,15,10,15,10,20,20,20} totaling 140 points; calculates total scores ranging from 15/140 (10.7%) to 128/140 (91.4%); generates normalized score plots and per-student performance trajectories across components; performs SVD on the grade matrix to identify dominant performance patterns; creates correlation density plots to reveal relationships between assessment components |
