# Analysis3

## Overview

Complete teaching archive for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2014), a graduate-level functional analysis course at ANU covering Hilbert spaces, operators, measure theory, spectral theory, and Banach spaces. The course followed Stein & Shakarchi's Real Analysis (Vol. III) chapters 4-6 and Functional Analysis (Vol. IV) chapter 1, with 14 enrolled students and strong satisfaction ratings (4.3/5 course, 4.2/5 instructor). The archive documents the complete pedagogical workflow: twelve lecture chapters (0-12) progressing from functional calculus motivation through Hilbert space foundations, compact operators, Fourier transforms, measure and integration theory, to spectral theory and Banach spaces; four problem sets with handwritten hints for tutorial discussion; four graded assignments (40% of grade) covering bounded linear transformations, Fourier analysis, measure theory, and spectral theory, with complete submission and grading records showing extensive feedback in red and blue ink; an essay component (20 marks) with 15 suggested topics, 12 drafts with instructor annotations, 4 example essays, and 13 final submissions; and a comprehensive final examination (3 hours, 135 points). Supporting materials include a complete reference library (Stein & Shakarchi volumes 1-4 plus five supplementary texts), student evaluation results, grade calculation spreadsheets and statistical analysis (Mathematica SVD and correlation matrices for 15 students across 10 components), a build script for XeLaTeX compilation and web deployment, shared LaTeX infrastructure (preamble defining theorem environments and Hilbert space macros), and a TODO list noting needed proof corrections in Carathéodory extension and Stone-Weierstrass theorems.
