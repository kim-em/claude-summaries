# ProblemSets

## Overview

Four problem sets for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2014), covering topics in Hilbert spaces, operators, Fourier analysis, measure theory, and functional analysis. Each problem set includes LaTeX source, compiled PDF, and most include handwritten hint PDFs with detailed solution strategies. Problem Set 1 discusses in tutorial July 28, Problem Set 2 in August (dates TBD), Problem Set 3 in tutorials August 25 and September 1, and Problem Set 4 timing not specified. The `flags.tex` file controls conditional compilation (currently set to `\notestrue` to include instructor notes).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `flags.tex` | LaTeX compilation flag controlling whether instructor notes are included (`\notestrue`) |
| `ProblemSet1.tex` | LaTeX source for Problem Set 1 (7 problems): closed subspaces in L², projections, uniqueness of midpoints in Hilbert vs Banach spaces, bounded linear transforms (BLTs), convergence of orthogonal projections, finite rank operators |
| `ProblemSet1.pdf` | Compiled Problem Set 1 (4 pages) for tutorial July 28 |
| `ProblemSet1-hints.pdf` | Handwritten hints for Problem Set 1 (4 pages, 389KB) with detailed solution strategies and approaches for each problem |
| `ProblemSet2.tex` | LaTeX source for Problem Set 2 (fewer problems, focuses on subspaces of L^p with zero integral condition) |
| `ProblemSet2.pdf` | Compiled Problem Set 2 (4 pages) |
| `ProblemSet2-hints.pdf` | Handwritten hints for Problem Set 2 (3 pages) with detailed proofs showing closedness via Hölder's inequality, projection formulas, and L¹ vs L² norm comparisons |
| `ProblemSet3.tex` | LaTeX source for Problem Set 3 (4 problems) with custom preamble: even/odd Fourier transforms, eigenfunctions of Fourier operator, approximation of identity, central limit theorem application |
| `ProblemSet3.pdf` | Compiled Problem Set 3 (2 pages) for tutorials August 25 and September 1 |
| `ProblemSet4.tex` | LaTeX source for Problem Set 4 (problems on advanced functional analysis topics) |
| `ProblemSet4.pdf` | Compiled Problem Set 4 (13 pages) |
| `ProblemSet4-hints.pdf` | Handwritten hints for Problem Set 4 (2 pages) with solution approaches |
