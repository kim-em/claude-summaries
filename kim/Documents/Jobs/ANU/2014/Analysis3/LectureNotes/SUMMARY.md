# LectureNotes

## Overview

Twelve complete lecture note chapters for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours, covering the progression from Hilbert spaces through Banach spaces. Each lecture consists of paired LaTeX source and compiled PDF files. The notes follow Stein & Shakarchi's Real Analysis (Vol. III) chapters 4-6 and Functional Analysis (Vol. IV) chapter 1, beginning with foundational material on Hilbert spaces and functional calculus (Lecture 0), then proceeding through compact operators, Fourier transforms, measure theory, integration theory, spectral theory, and culminating in Banach spaces. Notes include color-coded instructor annotations (green) for pedagogical details, proofs, and examples. Compiled for XeLaTeX with 20pt font for lecture projection.
