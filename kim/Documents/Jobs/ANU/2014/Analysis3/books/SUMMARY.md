## Overview

Reference textbook collection for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (2014). Contains the complete Stein & Shakarchi four-volume series covering Fourier, Complex, Real, and Functional Analysis with solutions manual for volume 3, plus five supplementary references on functional analysis, Hilbert spaces, and spectral theory by Bressan, Conway, Halmos, Helmberg, and Pedersen. These texts support the course's focus on Hilbert spaces, operators, measure theory, spectral theory, and Banach spaces.
