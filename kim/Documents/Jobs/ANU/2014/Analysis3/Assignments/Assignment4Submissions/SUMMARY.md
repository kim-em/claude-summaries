# Assignment4Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for Assignment 4 of MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2014). Contains 15 PDF submissions and one JPG correction from approximately 14-15 students. Assignment covered spectral theory, functional analysis, unitary operators, positive operators, Banach spaces, and weak convergence. Submissions include both timestamped scans (from November 7, 2014) and named submissions with student identifiers. Unlike Assignments 1-3, there is no "graded" subfolder, suggesting these submissions may not have been graded yet or grading was managed differently. Includes one PGP signature file, likely for verification purposes.
