## Overview

Example essays demonstrating expected quality and format for the MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours essay component (Semester 2, 2014). Contains four student essays (6-11 pages each, 206-228KB) covering advanced topics in functional analysis and representation theory: trace class operators and Lidskii's Theorem (Tom Phelan, 2009), the Peter-Weyl Theorem on compact Lie groups (Ben Lim, 2013), Bochner's Theorem on Fourier transforms (Yitao Lei, 2013), and fixed point theorems including Markov-Kakutani and Kakutani theorems (Hannah Keese, 2013). Essays illustrate appropriate mathematical exposition style, proof techniques, and breadth expected from students.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Example1.pdf` | "Trace Class Operators and Lidskii's Theorem" by Tom Phelan (Semester 2 2009) - 11-page essay providing self-contained derivation of Lidskii's Trace Theorem using antisymmetric tensor products and determinant function construction; covers spectrum theory, positive operators on Hilbert spaces, trace class operators, and connection between trace and determinant (137KB, references Reed & Simon) |
| `Example2.pdf` | "The Peter-Weyl Theorem" by Ben Lim (October 26, 2013) - 6-page essay proving that matrix coefficients are dense in L²(G) for compact Hausdorff groups; includes preliminaries on Haar measures and representation theory, with applications to representation theory of compact Lie groups (216KB) |
| `Example3.pdf` | "Bochner's Theorem on the Fourier Transform on R" by Yitao Lei (October 2013) - 9-page essay establishing necessary and sufficient conditions (continuous and positive-definite) for a function to be the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of a positive Borel measure; develops theory via Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients on the torus then extends to R, includes Herglotz's theorem (206KB) |
| `Example4.pdf` | "Fixed Point Theorems" by Hannah Keese (u5025630) - 8-page essay providing accessible exposition of Markov-Kakutani and Kakutani fixed point theorems with proofs; covers Brouwer's theorem, extends to infinite dimensions, includes application to Nash equilibrium in game theory (223KB, references Edwards, Fan, Glicksberg, Kakutani, Nash) |
