# Assignment3Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 3 (due October 7, 2014). Contains 14 PDF submissions including both named submissions (Daniel Filan, Damon Binder, Junxiao Wang, Marcus Hipkin) and timestamped scanned submissions (from October 3 and 7, 2014). Assignment covered measure theory topics including distribution functions, volume calculations using spherical coordinates and the gamma function, Lebesgue measure uniqueness, and convergence in measure. Unlike Assignments 1 and 2, this folder does not contain a "graded" subfolder, suggesting grading may have been done differently or graded versions stored elsewhere.
