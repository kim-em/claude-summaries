# Assignment1Graded

## Overview

Graded and annotated versions of student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 1 (August 2014). Contains 15 PDF files organized by student number (u-numbers), each with extensive handwritten feedback in red and blue ink. The annotations include total marks at the top of each paper (e.g., "77 + 19 = 96", "72 + 19 = 93"), circled question numbers, checkmarks for correct steps, detailed margin comments on proof techniques, and specific corrections. Feedback ranges from brief confirmations ("Good", "Well written!") to detailed pedagogical notes explaining conceptual issues ("This is not what 'not converging' means", "Actually I'm not convinced by what you've said", "It would be much clearer here to say you are using absolute continuity of the integral").
