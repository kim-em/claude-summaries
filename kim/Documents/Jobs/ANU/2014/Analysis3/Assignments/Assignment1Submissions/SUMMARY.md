# Assignment1Submissions

## Overview

Complete collection of student submissions and graded work for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 1 (due August 15, 2014). The ungraded folder contains 10 named student submissions plus one anonymous submission (u3979034.pdf). The Assignment1Graded subfolder contains 15 graded and extensively annotated versions with handwritten feedback in red and blue ink, showing detailed pedagogical engagement with student work. Annotations include total marks (e.g., "77 + 19 = 96", "72 + 19 = 93"), circled question numbers, checkmarks for correct steps, margin comments on proof techniques, and specific corrections ranging from brief confirmations to detailed explanations of conceptual issues. The assignment tested understanding of bounded linear transformations on Hilbert spaces: completeness of L(H), adjoints of integral operators, strong vs weak convergence, orthogonal projections, and integral operators on unit balls. The grading reveals careful attention to mathematical rigor, proof presentation, and pedagogical guidance on topics like absolute continuity of integrals, uniqueness of adjoints, and proper definitions of convergence.
