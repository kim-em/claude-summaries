# Assignment2Submissions

## Overview

Complete submission and grading workflow for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours Assignment 2 (Semester 2, 2014). Contains 20 original student submissions as PDFs (11 named submissions plus 9 timestamped scans from the same submission day, September 23, 2014), covering advanced topics in functional analysis including Fourier transform uniform convergence (Riemann-Lebesgue lemma), analyticity and Taylor series of Fourier transforms, convolution identities in L^1/L^2 spaces, and density arguments for bounded continuous functions in L^∞(R). Submissions show collaboration patterns (e.g., Thompson-Reddy pair) and include early submissions from July. The Assignment2Graded subdirectory documents the complete grading process with 16 graded PDFs containing extensive instructor feedback, red-pen corrections on proof structure and mathematical rigor, specific comments on notation (essential supremum vs supremum), and final scores ranging from 84/100 (with late penalty) to 120/100 (100+20 bonus). Grading completed October 1-3, 2014.
