# Assignment2Graded

## Overview

Graded versions of student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours Assignment 2 (Semester 2, 2014). Contains 16 scanned PDF files with instructor feedback, corrections, and numerical grades marked in red pen. Files are dated October 1-3, 2014, representing the grading period after the September 22-23 submission deadline. Feedback includes mathematical corrections, comments on proof structure (e.g., "write sentences that make page use of logical connectives," "explain more carefully"), and point allocations for individual problems covering Fourier transforms, L^p spaces, compact support functions, and density arguments.
