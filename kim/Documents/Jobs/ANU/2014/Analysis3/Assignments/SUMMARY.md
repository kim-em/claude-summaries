# Assignments

## Overview

Complete student assessment materials for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2014), documenting both the pedagogical design and the full grading workflow. Contains four graded assignments (due August 15, September 23, October 7, and November 7) covering advanced functional analysis: bounded linear transformations on Hilbert spaces, Fourier transforms and convolution in L^p spaces, measure theory and convergence, and spectral theory of operators. Each assignment includes LaTeX source, compiled PDFs, and sample solutions (for Assignments 1, 2, and 4). Student work reveals extensive pedagogical engagement: Assignment 1 and 2 submissions include graded subfolders with detailed handwritten feedback in red and blue ink showing careful attention to mathematical rigor, proof presentation, and conceptual understanding (scores ranging from 77/100 to 120/100). Approximately 10-15 students per assignment, with submissions showing collaboration patterns (e.g., Thompson-Reddy pairs) and varying submission formats (named PDFs, timestamped scans, with corrections as JPG files). The essay component demonstrates a complete writing workflow: 15 suggested topics from Dirichlet problems to Brownian motion, 12 draft essays with extensive instructor annotations (October 20-22), 4 example essays from previous years, and 13 final submissions on topics including Bochner's Theorem, fixed point theorems with game theory applications, and ergodic theory. Final examination (3 hours, 135 points, one double-sided A4 note sheet permitted) tests the full course scope with alternative questions documented separately. Assessment formed 40% of final grade (4 assignments × 20 marks each for content + 20 marks writing).
