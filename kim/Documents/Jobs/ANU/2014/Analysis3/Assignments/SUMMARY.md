# Assignments

## Overview

Student assessment materials for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2014). Contains four graded assignments covering operators on Hilbert spaces, compact operators, spectral theory, and integral operators. Each assignment includes LaTeX source, compiled PDFs, sample solutions (for Assignments 1, 2, and 4), and student submission folders. Also includes essay component materials (suggested topics, drafts, examples, final submissions) and the final examination with alternative questions. Assignments were due at regular intervals through the semester and formed 40% of the final grade (20 marks per assignment for mathematical content plus writing quality).
