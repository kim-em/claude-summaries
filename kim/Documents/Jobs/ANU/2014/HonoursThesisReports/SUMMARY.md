# HonoursThesisReports

## Overview

Honours thesis examination reports and theses for four mathematics students supervised at ANU in 2014, focusing on knot theory and Khovanov homology. Contains grader's reports (both TeX source and compiled PDFs) evaluating theses by Christopher Chung, Hannah Keese, Hilary Hunt, and Joshua Chen, along with complete thesis PDFs for Hannah Keese and Hilary Hunt. All four theses explored topics in Khovanov homology and related algebraic structures, with recommended grades ranging from 85-93 and one potential university medal candidate (Keese).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ChristopherChung-graders-report.tex` | Grader's report LaTeX source for Christopher Chung's master's thesis "A spanning tree model for Khovanov homology" by Morrison and Parker, praising "superb" exposition comparable to mature mathematicians, noting lack of original research but recommending grade of 93 |
| `ChristopherChung-graders-report.pdf` | Compiled grader's report for Chung's thesis (52KB) |
| `HannahKeese-graders-report.tex` | Grader's report LaTeX source by Alper and Morrison for Hannah Keese's thesis "Current algebras, categorification and annular Khovanov homology", highlighting original contributions (Theorems 2.4.5 and 4.4.1) including independent proof of unpublished Licata result, recommending grade 93 and suggesting possible university medal |
| `HannahKeese-graders-report.pdf` | Compiled grader's report for Keese's thesis (76KB) |
| `HannahKeese-thesis.pdf` | Complete honours thesis by Hannah Keese on current algebras and annular Khovanov homology (1.4MB) |
| `HilaryHunt-thesis-report.tex` | Grader's report LaTeX source by Morrison for Hilary Hunt's thesis "Knots, isotopies, and Khovanov homology", describing work on computing isotopy actions on Khovanov homology (first explicit computations in 15 years of research), noting implementation work completed post-submission, recommending grade around 85 |
| `HilaryHunt-thesis-report.pdf` | Compiled grader's report for Hunt's thesis (71KB) |
| `HilaryHunt-thesis.pdf` | Complete honours thesis by Hilary Hunt on knot isotopies and Khovanov homology (1.3MB) |
| `JoshuaChen-thesis-report.tex` | Grader's report LaTeX source by Morrison for Joshua Chen's thesis "The Temperley-Lieb categories and skein modules", detailing work on pivotal 2-categories and Turaev-Viro TFT construction via spines, praising original proof of semisimplicity at roots of unity (Chapter 5) and incomplete but promising work on skein modules (Chapter 6), recommending grade 85-90 |
| `JoshuaChen-thesis-report.pdf` | Compiled grader's report for Chen's thesis (99KB) |
