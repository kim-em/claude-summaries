# ASC category theory

## Overview

Marking materials and final student reports for the 2014 Australian Summer Course (ASC) in category theory, supervised by Scott Morrison. Contains grader's reports and final project reports from five students (Benjamin Thompson, Dominic Weiller, Jack Davies, Lachlan Maynard, and Prithvi Reddy) who completed independent study projects covering module theory, category theory fundamentals (functors, natural transformations, adjoint functors), and applications to representation theory and algebraic structures.
