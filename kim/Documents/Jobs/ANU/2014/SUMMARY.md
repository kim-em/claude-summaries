# 2014

## Overview

Third year of ANU faculty employment documenting teaching (MATH3325 Analysis 3, special topics course on link homology), supervision (Joshua Chen honours thesis completion, Hilary Hunt honours, Narjess Afzaly PhD committee), and notable achievements including the Christopher Heyde Medal from the Australian Academy of Sciences. Contains annual report showing extensive research travel (Maui, Vanderbilt, Banff, Austria, Oxford), multiple international visitors, active DECRA fellowship research on fusion categories and TQFTs, and significant publications on subfactor classification. Also includes market loading case documentation (April 2014), occupational health and safety incident report (Josh Chen's cut foot from broken glass), research project descriptions for potential students/postdocs, postdoctoral fellowship applications received, and ASC category theory student marking.
