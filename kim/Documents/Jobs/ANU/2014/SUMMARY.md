# 2014

## Overview

This folder documents Scott Morrison's third year (2014) of ANU faculty employment, encompassing a complete record of teaching, supervision, research administration, and professional recognition. The year was marked by substantial pedagogical documentation: a complete teaching archive for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (14 students, 4.3/5 satisfaction), a rigorous graduate-level functional analysis course featuring twelve lecture chapters, four problem sets, extensive assignment grading with handwritten feedback, and an essay component with detailed instructor annotations; and Australian Summer Course supervision of five category theory students (Benjamin Thompson, Dominic Weiller, Jack Davies, Lachlan Maynard, Prithvi Reddy). Supervision activities included examination of four exceptional honours theses in Khovanov homology and related topics (Christopher Chung, Hannah Keese, Hilary Hunt, Joshua Chen) with grades ranging 85-93, including one potential university medal candidate (Keese) who proved an unpublished result independently. Research administration work included processing 66 postdoctoral fellowship applications from 25 candidates across diverse mathematical specialties. Additional materials document the Christopher Heyde Medal award from the Australian Academy of Sciences, extensive international research travel and collaborations detailed in the annual report, active DECRA fellowship research on fusion categories and TQFTs, market loading salary case (April 2014), an occupational health incident report (broken glass injury), research project descriptions for prospective students/postdocs, and coordination of Algebra & Topology web pages. The folder provides a comprehensive view of academic life combining high-quality teaching with intensive research supervision and professional service.
