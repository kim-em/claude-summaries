# Amnon's postdocs

## Overview

Complete hiring materials for postdoctoral research fellow position #492617 in Amnon Neeman's research group at ANU. The folder contains compiled applications (~82MB PDF, too large to read) and 40 reference letters evaluating 10 candidates with diverse expertise across algebraic topology, representation theory, quantum groups, derived categories, and related areas. Reference letters come from prominent mathematicians at leading institutions (Yale, University of Chicago, UCLA, University of Toronto) including Eric Friedlander, Alexander Beilinson, Igor Frenkel, Paul Balmer, and Joel Kamnitzer. Candidates include Jesse Burke (commutative algebra, matrix factorizations), Tanmay Deshpande (character sheaves, Drinfeld's theory), Ivan Ip (quantum groups, C*-algebras), Bregje Pauwels (triangulated categories, modular representation theory), Peter Samuelson (character varieties, DAHA), and William Sanders (derived categories, semidualizing modules).
