# Applications - Postdoctoral Fellow_Research Fellow

## Overview

Postdoctoral fellowship hiring materials for ANU position #507048, a second postdoctoral position alongside Amnon Neeman's position (#492617). Contains the complete compiled applications PDF (42MB) documenting all candidate materials, a shortlist PDF (8.7MB) with narrowed-down candidates, and comprehensive referee reports for 14 exceptional candidates. The candidate pool represents outstanding early-career mathematicians working at the intersection of representation theory, topology, quantum algebra, and mathematical physics, including Appel (monodromy theorems, quasi-Coxeter categories), Chapman (ergodic algorithms, subfactor planar algebras), Cui ((3+1)-TQFTs, anyonic quantum computation), Ganev (quantum groups, hypertoric varieties), Grant (categorified quantum groups, knot homology), Hilburn (symplectic duality, 3D mirror symmetry), Hogancamp (categorified representation theory, GORS conjectures), Jones (tensor categories, subfactors), Matherne (geometric representation theory, cluster algebras), Mazel-Gee (model ∞-categories, derived algebraic geometry), Ros Camacho (matrix factorizations, Landau-Ginzburg/CFT correspondence), Samuelson (skein algebras, DAHA), Titsworth (fusion category classification), and White (Bethe algebras, quantum groups). Each candidate received 3-8 letters from distinguished mathematicians including Fields medalists, leading category theorists, and pioneers in quantum topology. This represents a remarkably strong applicant pool across interconnected areas: categorified representation theory and knot homology, tensor categories and subfactors, geometric representation theory, derived algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, and mathematical physics connections.
