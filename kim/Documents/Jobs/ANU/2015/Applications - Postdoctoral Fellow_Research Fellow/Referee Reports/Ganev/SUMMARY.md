# Ganev

## Overview

Reference letters for Iordan Ganev, a PhD candidate completing his doctorate under David Ben-Zvi at UT Austin in 2015. The five letters provide exceptionally strong recommendations emphasizing Ganev's groundbreaking work in quantum groups and geometric representation theory, particularly his contributions to hypertoric quantum groups at roots of unity and the quantum wonderful compactification. Referees consistently highlight his technical brilliance, breadth of knowledge, clear exposition, leadership abilities, and promising collaborative network spanning multiple institutions.
