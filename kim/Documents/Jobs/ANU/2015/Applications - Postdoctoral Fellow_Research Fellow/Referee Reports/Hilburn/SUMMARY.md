# Hilburn

## Overview

Reference letters for Justin Hilburn, a PhD candidate at University of Oregon under Nick Proudfoot, specializing in geometric representation theory, symplectic duality, and connections to mathematical physics. The six letters (from Ben Webster, David Ben-Zvi, Michael Price, Nicholas Proudfoot, Thomas Nevins, and Tudor Dimofte) provide exceptionally strong recommendations emphasizing Hilburn's breakthrough collaboration with physicists (Bullimore, Gaiotto, Dimofte) connecting symplectic duality to 3D mirror symmetry, his technical mastery of quantized symplectic varieties, and his unique ability to bridge mathematics and physics.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Ben Webster (18122015).pdf` | Letter from Ben Webster (U. Virginia) praising Hilburn's independence, deep understanding of geometric representation theory beyond his advisor, collaboration with senior physicists on boundary conditions and Coulomb branch construction, work on Harish-Chandra bimodules and Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier 2-quantum groups, and joint topology paper with Bibby |
| `David Ben-Zvi (21122015).pdf` | Letter from David Ben-Zvi (UT Austin) describing Hilburn's crucial role in BDGH collaboration making precise the connection between symplectic duality and 3D mirror symmetry through boundary conditions, emphasizing breakthrough introduction of Whittaker modules and Jacquet functor to symplectic duality, and noting the work is attracting major attention at workshops |
| `Michael Price (07012016).pdf` | Letter from Michael Price (U. Oregon Assistant Head) evaluating Hilburn's teaching performance as graduate teaching fellow 2010-2016 - taught precalculus, business calculus, and multivariable calculus with good student evaluations (3.5/5 average) and positive feedback on his compassion and desire to help students succeed |
| `Nicholas Proudfoot (18122015).pdf` | Letter from advisor Nick Proudfoot (U. Oregon) calling Hilburn "a rising star" whose technical strength has "long ago surpassed mine," describing his work on symplectic duality for hypertoric varieties, collaboration with physicists on Coulomb branch definition and boundary conditions, conjectures on Harish-Chandra bimodules and multi-fusion categories, and joint topology paper with Bibby on rational homotopy theory |
| `Thomas Nevins (31122015).pdf` | Letter from Thomas Nevins (UIUC) emphasizing Hilburn's unique position as both indispensable collaborator with physicists Dimofte-Gaiotto-Bullimore and mathematical expert ready to prove symplectic duality, his discovery that boundary conditions produce Whittaker modules (not category O objects), mastery of hypertoric combinatorics, and comparing him favorably to Proudfoot and Webster at same career stage |
| `Tudor Dimofte (17122015).pdf` | Letter from collaborator Tudor Dimofte (UC Davis/Perimeter Institute, physicist) describing Hilburn as equal collaborator (not just consultant) whose mathematical insights on Koszul duality were critical to their work, his search for clearest intuitive perspective (multiple proofs of projective objects as Whittaker deformations), exceptional communication skills bridging math/physics, comparing him favorably to postdocs from IAS/Princeton/Harvard |
