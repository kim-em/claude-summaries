# Ros Camacho

## Overview

Reference letters for Ana Ros Camacho, a candidate for the ANU postdoctoral fellowship position. Contains 6 exceptionally strong recommendations from distinguished mathematicians and physicists (Davydov, Runkel, Mulase, Buchweitz, Holtkamp, Manin) for a PhD candidate specializing in matrix factorizations, Landau-Ginzburg/conformal field theory correspondence, categorical algebra, and orbifold equivalences. Letters emphasize her deep mathematical understanding, successful PhD defense in November 2014, strong research accomplishments including multiple published papers, excellent teaching experience in both English and German, and potential to become a leading researcher in mathematical physics and mirror symmetry.
