# Matherne

## Overview

Reference letters for Jacob Matherne, a PhD candidate at Louisiana State University under Pramod Achar's supervision. The five letters (from Ben-Zvi, Todorov, Oxley, Smith, and Achar) provide exceptionally strong recommendations emphasizing Matherne's research in geometric representation theory, cluster algebras, exceptional sequences, and derived geometric Satake equivalence. Multiple referees note his unusual productivity and independence for a graduate student, with publications already being cited and used by leading researchers in the field. Letters also highlight his excellence in teaching (winner of multiple teaching awards at LSU) and his ability to bridge abstract theory with concrete computational methods.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `David Ben-Zvi (21122015).pdf` | 3-page letter from UT Austin professor emphasizing Matherne's work on cluster algebras (with Muller), exceptional sequences (with Garver et al.), derived geometric Satake correspondence, and collaboration with Ganev on Cherednik algebras using moment graphs |
| `Gordana Todorov (18122015).pdf` | 3-page letter from Northeastern professor focusing on Matherne's cluster algebra contributions, particularly the upper cluster algebra algorithm with Muller and exceptional sequences work with combinatorial techniques |
| `James Oxley (19122015).pdf` | 1-page letter from LSU Boyd Professor emphasizing Matherne's exceptional teaching record, with student evaluations averaging 3.75-3.93 out of 4.0 and winner of the David Oxley Graduate Student Teaching Award |
| `Karen Smith (11012016).pdf` | 2-page letter from University of Michigan professor supporting NSF postdoc application, commenting on the Matherne-Muller cluster algebra work and its utility to other researchers (Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, Canekei-Lee-Schiffer) |
| `Pramod Achar (21122015).pdf` | 3-page letter from Matherne's PhD advisor at LSU describing all research areas (cluster algebras, exceptional sequences, moment graphs/Cherednik algebras, derived Satake/Springer theory) and emphasizing Matherne's exceptional independence and productivity as a graduate student |
