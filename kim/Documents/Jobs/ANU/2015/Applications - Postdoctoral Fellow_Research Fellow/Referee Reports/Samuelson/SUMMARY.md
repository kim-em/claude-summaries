# Samuelson

## Overview

Reference letters for Peter Samuelson, a postdoctoral candidate specializing in skein algebras, topological representation theory, and quantum topology. Contains three exceptionally strong recommendations from distinguished mathematicians (Frohman, Khovanov, Berest) praising his groundbreaking work connecting double affine Hecke algebras (DAHA) to knot theory, his discovery of the isomorphism between HOMFLY skein algebras and elliptic Hall algebras, and his topological construction of Cherednik polynomials. The letters emphasize his unique combination of deep understanding in quantum algebra, classical ring theory, and low-dimensional topology, along with exceptional communication and collaboration skills.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Charles Frohman (20122015).pdf | Enthusiastic recommendation from Frohman praising Samuelson as "currently the best young person working on skein algebras" with exceptional computational skills comparable to Thang Le or Razvan Gelca, highlighting work on DAHA actions on skein modules, HOMFLY skein algebra of the torus, elliptic Hall algebra connections, and collaboration with Berest and Licata |
| Mikhail Khovanov (08012016).pdf | Strong recommendation from Khovanov (Columbia) highlighting Samuelson's work relating Cherednik algebras to low-dimensional topology, joint paper with Berest on deforming skein algebra actions, work with Morton on HOMFLY skein algebra isomorphic to elliptic Hall algebra, and proof of Cherednik-Danilenko conjecture |
| Yuri Berest (22122015).pdf | Extremely detailed and enthusiastic 4-page recommendation from PhD advisor Berest (Cornell) describing Samuelson as "among the very best (perhaps top 2 or 3) Ph.D. students graduated from Cornell in the past 15 years," with comprehensive technical discussion of dissertation work on topological realization of DAHA, joint paper on generalized Jones polynomials, Morton collaboration on elliptic Hall algebras, and praise for distinctive teaching style |
