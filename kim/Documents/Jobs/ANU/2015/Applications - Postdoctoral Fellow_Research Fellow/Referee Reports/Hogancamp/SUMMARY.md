# Hogancamp

## Overview

Three exceptionally strong reference letters for Matt Hogancamp's application to the ANU postdoctoral fellowship position. The letters are from three distinguished mathematicians: Ben Webster (University of Virginia), Mikhail Khovanov (Columbia University), and Slava Krushkal (University of Virginia, Hogancamp's PhD advisor). All three letters emphasize Hogancamp's groundbreaking work in categorified representation theory, knot homology, and his resolution of influential conjectures by Gorsky-Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende relating knot homology to Hilbert schemes and Cherednik algebras.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Ben Webster (07012016).pdf` | Letter from Ben Webster (Assistant Professor, UVa) emphasizing Hogancamp as "the world's foremost expert on colored knot homology" and describing his work on polynomial actions, Jones-Wenzl projectors, and ongoing collaboration with Ben Elias on finitized projections for all representations of sl_n |
| `Mikhail Khovanov (08012016).pdf` | Letter from Mikhail Khovanov (Professor, Columbia) rating Hogancamp "as one of the very top people currently on the job market" and detailing his breakthrough on finite-dimensional categorification of colored Jones polynomial via polynomial actions, plus work on torus links and the Soergel category |
| `Slava Krushkal (18122015).pdf` | Letter from Slava Krushkal (Professor, UVa, Hogancamp's PhD advisor) describing Hogancamp's "deep and original work" resolving GORS conjectures, his PhD thesis on bounded chain complexes for quasi-idempotents, and positioning him "among the top tier of young researchers in the subject" |
