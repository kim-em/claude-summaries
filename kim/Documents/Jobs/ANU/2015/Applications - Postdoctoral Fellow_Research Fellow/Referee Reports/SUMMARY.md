# Referee Reports

## Overview

Organized collection of reference letters for 14 candidates in the ANU postdoctoral fellowship search (position #507048). Each candidate has a dedicated subdirectory containing 3-8 reference letters from established researchers in their field. The candidates span research areas including algebraic topology, quantum topology, representation theory, and related mathematical fields. This directory structure facilitates systematic evaluation and comparison of candidate qualifications during the hiring process.
