# Referee Reports

## Overview

Comprehensive collection of reference letters for 14 exceptional candidates in the ANU postdoctoral fellowship search (position #507048). The candidate pool represents outstanding early-career mathematicians working at the intersection of representation theory, topology, quantum algebra, and mathematical physics. Each candidate received 3-8 letters from distinguished mathematicians including Fields medalists, leading category theorists, and pioneers in quantum topology. Common themes across recommendations include exceptional research productivity, breakthrough results in their respective fields, strong interdisciplinary work (particularly mathematics-physics connections), and outstanding teaching records. The collection spans diverse but interconnected areas: categorified representation theory and knot homology (Hogancamp, Grant, Samuelson), tensor categories and subfactors (Jones, Cui, Titsworth), geometric representation theory (Ganev, Matherne, Hilburn), derived algebraic geometry and homotopy theory (Mazel-Gee), and mathematical physics connections (Hilburn, Ros Camacho, Appel). This directory structure facilitates systematic evaluation of a remarkably strong applicant pool during the hiring process.
