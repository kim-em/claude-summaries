# Jones

## Overview

Reference letters for Corey Jones, a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University under the supervision of Vaughan Jones (the Fields Medalist). Contains 3 exceptionally strong recommendation letters from distinguished mathematicians supporting his application for the ANU postdoctoral fellowship. Jones's research focuses on tensor categories, planar algebras, subfactors, and quantum groups, with particular emphasis on representation theory and approximation properties of rigid C*-tensor categories.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Dietmar Bisch (17122015).pdf | Strongly supportive letter from Dietmar Bisch (Professor & Chair at Vanderbilt, Director of Center for Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebras) detailing Corey Jones's thesis work on representations and approximation properties of rigid C*-tensor categories, his joint paper with Ghosh on annular algebras and tube algebras, work on quantum G2 categories with property (T), and multiple ongoing projects including planar algebras generated by 3-boxes and principal graph obstructions |
| Stefaan Vaes (18122015).pdf | Very warm recommendation from Stefaan Vaes (KU Leuven) emphasizing Jones's joint work with Ghosh providing alternative description of representation theory via Ocneanu's tube algebra, breakthrough proof that Rep(G2,q) has property (T), and remarking on Jones's "remarkably broad expertise ranging from subfactors to quantum groups, tensor categories, and geometric group theory" |
| Vaughan Jones.pdf | Strong letter of support from Vaughan Jones himself (FRS, NAS, Fields Medalist and Stevenson Professor at Vanderbilt), Jones's PhD advisor, describing him as "an unusually good student" with extraordinary energy, detailing his two published papers (Ghosh-Jones on annular representation theory, and quantum G2 property (T) paper), and noting numerous ongoing projects including work on whether all subfactors come from conformal field theory |
