# Chapman

## Overview

Reference letters for Kyle Chapman's application to the ANU postdoctoral fellowship (position #507048). Chapman completed his PhD at UC Santa Barbara in June 2015, working with Kenneth Millett on knot theory and with Stephen Bigelow on planar algebras. The three letters strongly emphasize his exceptional teaching abilities (receiving department teaching award in 2014), his remarkable dissertation on ergodic algorithms for random thick knots, and his creative, independent research in subfactor planar algebras and quantum topology.
