# Cui

## Overview

Reference letters for Xingshan Cui (Shawn) applying for the ANU postdoctoral position. Contains two strong recommendations emphasizing his exceptional talent in quantum topology/algebra and topological quantum computation. His advisor Zhenghan Wang describes him as the best student he has supervised and among the very best PhD students he has encountered. The letters highlight fundamental contributions to (3+1)-TQFTs, gauging symmetries of modular categories, and making weakly integral anyons universal for quantum computation through measurement-based protocols.
