# Titsworth

## Overview

Reference letters for Matthew Titsworth - 4 exceptionally strong recommendations from distinguished mathematicians and physicists (Penneys, Ardonne, Hagge, Wang) for PhD candidate at University of Texas at Dallas specializing in classification of fusion and modular categories, geometric invariant theory, and computational methods for solving pentagon equations. Titsworth developed the most powerful computer package for solving pentagons with multiplicities, applied geometric invariant theory to construct complete sets of invariants for classifying fusion categories, and demonstrated strong ability to bridge mathematics and physics communities. Letters emphasize his ambitious and tenacious character, multidisciplinary research spanning quantum topology, conformal field theory, topological phases of matter, and subfactor theory, with excellent fit for working with Scott Morrison at ANU.
