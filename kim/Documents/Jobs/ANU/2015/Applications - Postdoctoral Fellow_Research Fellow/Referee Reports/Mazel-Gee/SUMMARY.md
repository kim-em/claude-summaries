# Mazel-Gee

## Overview

Reference letters for Aaron Mazel-Gee, a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley specializing in algebraic topology and homotopy theory. Six exceptionally strong recommendations from distinguished mathematicians (Blumberg, Barwick, Ayala, Olsson, Goerss, Teichner) emphasizing his groundbreaking thesis work on model ∞-categories and Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory, his remarkable independence working largely without traditional homotopy theory supervision, his exceptional technical facility with higher category theory, and his prolific output with six papers already published/accepted. His research focuses on derived algebraic geometry, motivic homotopy theory, and factorization homology.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Andrew Blumberg (20122015).pdf | Strong recommendation from UT Austin professor who organized MSRI algebraic topology semester. Emphasizes Mazel-Gee's creative thesis generalizing Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory to any suitable homotopical category using ∞-categories, his development of "model ∞-categories" formalism for controlling resolutions, mastery of quasicategories, and exciting applications to homotopy limit problems in simplicial spaces and algebraic K-theory. |
| Clark Barwick (24122015).pdf | Strong recommendation from MIT professor. Describes Mazel-Gee as "one of the most energetic graduate student I've ever encountered" with exceptional originality and technical ability. Highlights his proper understanding of higher categories, his theory of model ∞-categories, joint work with Gepner on motivic Morava stabilizer groups discovering "exotic" elements not seen classically, and notes he is a "closer" who completes papers (six already out). |
| David Ayala (08012016).pdf | Strong recommendation from Montana State professor (current host). Ranks Mazel-Gee "among the top five algebraic topologists of his peer group" for conceptual capacity and technical facility. Details work on structural aspects of derived algebraic geometry, model ∞-categories for localization problems, and new joint project on recasting cyclotomic trace maps via factorization homology for ∞-categories to reveal connections between iterated K-theory, higher-dimensional manifolds, and TQFTs. |
| Martin Olsson (17122015).pdf | Outstanding teaching recommendation from UC Berkeley professor. Reviews teaching evaluations showing exceptionally high scores (6.4-6.9 out of 7) for calculus sections, student comments praising preparation and caring attitude, and active participation in pedagogy course. Confident Mazel-Gee "will not only be a good teacher but in fact continue to be an outstanding instructor." |
| Paul Goerrs (17122015).pdf | Strong recommendation from Northwestern professor (co-originator of Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory). Explains Mazel-Gee's project to adapt Dwyer-Kan-Stover obstruction theory to derived algebraic geometry using model ∞-categories, solving localization problems that plagued the original DKS theory. Describes proposed application to motivic Lubin-Tate theory as important, notes joint paper with Peterson and Stapleton on relative Lubin-Tate theory (accepted AG&T), and praises his independence working outside traditional homotopy theory supervision. |
| Peter Teichner (21122015).pdf | Strongest recommendation from UC Berkeley thesis advisor and Max Planck director. Notes Mazel-Gee "worked completely independently" and "has become a leading expert in the homotopy theory of ∞-categories" surpassing advisor's own expertise. Details publications (AG&T, HHA) and main thesis work on computing mapping spaces for ∞-categories via model structures, joint work with Gepner on motivic Morava K-theories showing E∞-automorphism groups are essentially discrete, and promising new project with Ayala on factorization homology for cyclotomic trace. "Strongest recommendation" for first-rate position. |
