# Appel

## Overview

Collection of six reference letters for Andrea Appel's application to the ANU postdoctoral fellowship (position #507048). The letters, dated between October 2015 and January 2016, are from distinguished mathematicians including Aaron Lauda (USC), Andrei Okounkov (Columbia), Eric Friedlander (USC), Pavel Etingof (MIT), and Valerio Toledano Laredo (Northeastern, his PhD advisor). All letters strongly recommend Appel for his groundbreaking work on monodromy theorems for Casimir connections in Kac-Moody algebras, his introduction of quasi-Coxeter categories, and exceptional teaching and collegial contributions.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Aaron Lauda (17122015).pdf` | Strong recommendation from USC Professor highlighting Appel's work on Coxeter categories, KZ-equations, Casimir connections, exceptional teaching (popular quantum groups course), and extensive service to USC department and mathematics community |
| `Andrei Okounov (08012016).pdf` | First letter from Columbia Professor (Eilenberg Chair) praising Appel's extension of monodromy theorem to affine Lie algebras, mastery of advanced technical tools, and multilayered project with advisor Toledano Laredo |
| `Andrei Okounov (2) (15012016).pdf` | Updated letter adding note about completion of arXiv:1512.03041, which proves the equivalence of monodromy and quantum Weyl group action - calls it "a landmark result" confirming very high opinion |
| `Eric Friedlander (18122015).pdf` | Letter from USC Dean's Professor describing Appel as "one of the strongest candidates" in representation theory, exceptional post-doc whose contributions and absence will be felt throughout department, stellar research and teaching |
| `Pavel Etingof (18122015).pdf` | Detailed MIT Professor letter explaining technical achievements: extending monodromy theorem using Etingof-Kazhdan quantization, introducing quasi-Coxeter categories, developing new PROP-based deformation theory, comparable to strongest MIT graduates |
| `Valeria Toledano Laredo (18122015).pdf` | Comprehensive letter from PhD advisor at Northeastern describing thesis work, post-thesis achievements on rigidity of quasi-Coxeter structures, completion of three-paper sequence proving monodromy theorem for arbitrary Kac-Moody algebras |
