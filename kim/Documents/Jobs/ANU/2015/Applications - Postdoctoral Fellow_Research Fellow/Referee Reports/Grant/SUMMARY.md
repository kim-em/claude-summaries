# Grant

## Overview

Reference letters for Jonathan Grant, a PhD candidate at Durham University specializing in categorified quantum groups and knot homology theory. Contains 4 exceptionally strong recommendation letters from distinguished mathematicians (Andrew Lobb, Jacob Rasmussen, Norbert Peyerimhoff, Pedro Vaz) emphasizing his independent research abilities, significant contributions to categorifying gl(m|n) representation theory and the Alexander polynomial, and excellent teaching skills. Letters highlight his work on quantum knot homology, categorification of skew Howe duality, and connections between Khovanov-Rozansky homology and Heegaard-Floer homology.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Andrew Lobb (07012016).pdf | Research reference from PhD supervisor at Durham - describes Grant as "very strong mathematician" with two publications and third under review, working independently on categorified quantum groups and Alexander polynomial categorification, worthy of postdoc at top institution |
| Jacob Rasmussen (21122015).pdf | Reference from Cambridge Reader emphasizing Grant's mastery of categorification tools and significant contributions to understanding gl(m|n) homology through skew Howe duality, calling him "comparable to other young people with postdocs in this field" |
| Norbert Peyerimhoff (22122015).pdf | Teaching reference from Durham Professor documenting Grant's excellent tutorial teaching in Analysis 1 and Geometric Topology courses, with student quotes praising his clear explanations and supportive approach |
| Pedro Vaz (11012016).pdf | Reference from Université catholique de Louvain emphasizing Grant's expertise in representation theory governing the Alexander polynomial, his three single-authored papers as PhD student, and collaborative abilities demonstrated during institute visit |
