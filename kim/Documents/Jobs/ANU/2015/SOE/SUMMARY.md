# SOE

## Overview

Statement of Expectations (SOE) documents for Scott Morrison's 2015 academic review period at ANU. Contains both the editable Word document and final signed PDF outlining performance expectations across research (40%), education (40%), and service (20%) responsibilities. The SOE establishes goals including continuing Discovery Project research on quantum symmetries and subfactors, teaching MATH1014, PhD supervision, HDR convenor duties, MathOverflow moderation, committee work, and organizing international research programs at Isaac Newton Institute and MSRI.

| `Morrison SOE July 2015.pdf` | Final signed Statement of Expectations (2 pages, dated June 29, 2015) establishing performance goals: research on quantum symmetries per Discovery Project grant, publishing in international journals, applying for future funding; teaching MATH1014 Semester 2 2015 and supervising PhD/honours students; continuing as HDR convenor, MathOverflow moderator/board member, arXiv mathematics advisory board member, MSI IT and building committee member; co-organizing 2017 Subfactors program at Isaac Newton Institute Cambridge and 2018 Tensor Categories program at MSRI Berkeley. Career development plan emphasizes developing teaching skills (first large first-year class), improving PhD supervision capabilities, and exploring higher categorical structures with applications to classification theory and representation theory. Signed by Scott Morrison and supervisor Andrew Hassell. |
