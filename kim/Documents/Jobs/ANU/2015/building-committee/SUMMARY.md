# building-committee

## Overview

Materials from Scott Morrison's service on the MSI building committee for the proposed CECS/MSI Building at ANU in 2015. Contains comprehensive architectural planning documentation including functional design briefs, accommodation requirements, and a detailed workplace questionnaire capturing MSI's operational needs for the new building. The documentation covers site planning for a joint College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) and Mathematical Sciences Institute (MSI) building to be located at the Chemistry 1 Building site, with detailed space requirements, office layouts, and workplace design considerations emphasizing the importance of accessible faculty offices, blackboard-equipped meeting spaces, and natural lighting for mathematical research.
