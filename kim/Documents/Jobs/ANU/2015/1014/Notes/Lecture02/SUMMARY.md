# Lecture02

## Overview

Second lecture of MATH1014 covering vector multiplication operations (dot product and cross product) in ℝ³. The lecture introduces the dot product as a scalar result, its relationship to magnitude and angles between vectors, and applications to scalar/vector projections. The second half covers the cross product (specific to ℝ³), including its geometric interpretation, determinant computation method, and properties. The lecture includes worked examples demonstrating applications to right triangle detection, coplanarity testing, work calculations in physics, and projection computations.
