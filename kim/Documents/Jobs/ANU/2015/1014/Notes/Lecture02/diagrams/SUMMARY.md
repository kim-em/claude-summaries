# diagrams

## Overview

Collection of visual diagrams supporting MATH1014 Lecture 02 on dot and cross products. Contains both vector illustrations (PDF format) for geometric concepts like angle between vectors, vector projections, and scalar projections, plus one PNG image illustrating the right-hand rule for cross products. Also includes an OmniGraffle source file for one of the diagrams. These diagrams are referenced in the parent lecture's LaTeX presentation.
