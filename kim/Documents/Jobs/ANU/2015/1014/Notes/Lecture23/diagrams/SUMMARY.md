# diagrams

## Overview

Collection of geometric diagrams illustrating the least squares problem and orthogonal projection onto the column space of a matrix. Contains three PNG images showing the progressive geometric interpretation of least squares solutions, three PDF diagrams for worked examples, and one PDF showing a best-fit line visualization with data points. These diagrams support the theoretical content of Lecture 23 on least squares approximations.
