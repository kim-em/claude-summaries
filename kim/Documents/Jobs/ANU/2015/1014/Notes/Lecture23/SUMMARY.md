# Lecture23

## Overview

Twenty-third lecture on the Least Squares Problem (Lay §6.5), which addresses finding best approximations to inconsistent linear systems. The lecture derives the normal equations A^TA x̂ = A^T b as the method for finding least squares solutions, proves existence and uniqueness conditions, and includes three detailed worked examples. Also includes optional material on QR factorization as a numerically stable alternative method for computing least squares solutions. Supported by 7 diagrams illustrating geometric interpretation of projections onto column spaces.
