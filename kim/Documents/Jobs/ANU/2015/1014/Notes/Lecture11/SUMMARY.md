# Lecture11

## Overview

Lecture 11 materials on eigenvectors and eigenvalues, introducing this fundamental concept in linear algebra for the first time in MATH1014. The lecture covers the basic definitions of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, eigenspaces as null spaces of (A - λI), the special case of triangular matrices, linear independence of eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues, and worked examples including finding bases for eigenspaces. Includes both compiled PDF outputs (slides and annotated "scribble" version) and supporting diagram.
