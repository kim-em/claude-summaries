# Lecture16

## Overview

Sixteenth lecture on matrix representations of linear transformations for MATH1014. This lecture bridges diagonalization theory (from Lecture 15) with coordinate systems, showing that diagonalizing a matrix amounts to finding a basis where the linear transformation has a diagonal matrix representation. Key topics include: standard matrices for linear transformations, matrix representations relative to arbitrary bases, the three-step algorithm for computing transformation matrices, and the fundamental theorem connecting diagonalization A = PDP⁻¹ to finding a basis of eigenvectors where the transformation has diagonal B-matrix.
