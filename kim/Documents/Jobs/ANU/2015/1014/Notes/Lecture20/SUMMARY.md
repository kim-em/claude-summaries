# Lecture20

## Overview

Twentieth lecture on orthogonal and orthonormal sets in linear algebra (MATH1014, Lay §6.2). Introduces orthogonal sets as collections of pairwise orthogonal vectors, proves that orthogonal sets of nonzero vectors are linearly independent, and develops the theory of orthogonal bases with convenient formulas for computing coordinates. Extends to orthonormal sets (orthogonal unit vectors) and orthogonal matrices, showing that matrices with orthonormal columns satisfy U^TU = I and preserve lengths and orthogonality under linear transformation. Contains detailed worked examples on finding orthogonal vectors, computing coordinates in orthogonal bases, and constructing orthonormal matrices.
