# Lecture12

## Overview

Mid-semester examination review lecture for MATH1014, containing worked solutions to sample questions from the 2013 mid-semester exam. The lecture systematically covers five major topic areas (lines/planes in ℝ³, bases/coordinates in polynomial spaces, vector space verification, linear transformations on matrix spaces, and subspace computations), followed by comprehensive revision questions organized by theme. The folder includes the LaTeX source, both presentation PDF and annotated scribble PDF, plus a diagrams folder with supporting visual materials.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MATH1014-LinearAlgebra-Lecture12.tex` | LaTeX source for exam review lecture (15.4KB, 395 lines) covering 5 sample problems with detailed solutions: planes/lines (normal vectors, orthogonal lines, plane equations via cross products), polynomial coordinate systems (basis conversions in ℙ₂), vector space verification (integer matrices, orthogonal complements, constant polynomials), linear transformations on M₂ₓ₂ (kernel/range computations), and matrix subspaces (Nul A and Col A bases, geometric interpretation), plus thematic revision questions on definitions, ℝ³ geometry, and bases |
| `MATH1014-LinearAlgebra-Lecture12.pdf` | Compiled presentation slides PDF (192KB, generated from .tex source via makefile) |
| `MATH1014-LinearAlgebra-Lecture12.scribble.pdf` | Annotated version of lecture slides with handwritten work (3.3MB, likely created during lecture presentation) |
