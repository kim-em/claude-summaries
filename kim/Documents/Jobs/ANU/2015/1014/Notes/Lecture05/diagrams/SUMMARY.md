# diagrams

## Overview

Contains mathematical diagrams and figures for Lecture 5, including 3D coordinate system illustrations (planes and quadrants), vector diagrams, and linear transformation visualizations. The diagrams appear to be for a mathematics or linear algebra course, showing geometric concepts in both 2D and 3D space.
