# Lecture05

## Overview

Fifth lecture introducing abstract vector spaces and subspaces in MATH1014. The lecture transitions from concrete Euclidean vectors to abstract algebraic structures, presenting the formal 10-axiom definition of vector spaces and proving that various mathematical objects (matrices, polynomials, functions) satisfy these axioms. Major topics include vector space examples (M₂ₓ₂, Pₙ, functions, positive reals with exotic operations), the three-axiom subspace definition, and the span construction as a "recipe for building subspaces." The lecture emphasizes geometric intuition (planes through origin vs. translated planes) while developing algebraic rigor (references Lay §4.1). Supporting diagrams illustrate key geometric concepts including 3D coordinate systems with planes, first quadrant counterexamples, and linear transformations.
