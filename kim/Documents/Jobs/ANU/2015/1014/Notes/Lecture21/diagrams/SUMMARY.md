## Overview

Supporting geometric diagrams for Lecture 21 on orthogonal projections. Contains four PDFs illustrating key concepts: projection of vector y onto a 1D subspace (ex1.pdf), orthogonal decomposition of y into components in W and W⊥ with basis vectors u₁, u₂ (ex2.pdf), projection ŷ of y onto subspace W with orthogonal component z (ex3.pdf), and the Best Approximation Theorem showing ŷ is the closest point in W to y using triangle inequality (la2201.pdf).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ex1.pdf` | Geometric diagram showing projection of vector y onto 1D subspace spanned by u₁, illustrating formula ŷ = (y·u₁/u₁·u₁)u₁ with origin O and dashed projection lines |
| `ex2.pdf` | 3D diagram of orthogonal decomposition y = ŷ + z where ŷ ∈ W (plane spanned by u₁, u₂) and z ∈ W⊥ (perpendicular to plane), showing basis vectors and decomposition components |
| `ex3.pdf` | Shaded plane W showing projection ŷ = proj_W(y) with orthogonal component z, illustrating the orthogonal decomposition with origin O and dashed perpendicular line from y to ŷ |
| `la2201.pdf` | Best Approximation Theorem illustration: geometric proof that ŷ is closest point in W to y, showing distances ||y - ŷ||, ||y - v||, ||ŷ - v|| forming right triangle by Pythagorean theorem, demonstrating ||y - ŷ|| < ||y - v|| for any v ≠ ŷ in W |
