# Lecture21

## Overview

Lecture 21 materials for MATH1014 focusing on orthogonal projections onto subspaces. The lecture generalizes the 2D/3D projection formula to higher-dimensional subspaces, covering the Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem (decomposing vectors as y = ŷ + z where ŷ ∈ W and z ∈ W⊥), the Best Approximation Theorem (showing ŷ is the closest vector in W to y), and the matrix formula proj_W(y) = UU^T y for orthonormal bases. Content includes multiple worked examples in ℝ³ and ℝ⁴, distance calculations from vectors to subspaces, and applications to finding orthogonal bases.
