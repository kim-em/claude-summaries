# Lecture21

## Overview

Lecture 21 materials for MATH1014 focusing on orthogonal projections onto subspaces, building on the orthogonality foundations from Lecture 20. The lecture generalizes the 2D/3D projection formula to arbitrary-dimensional subspaces, developing two major theoretical results: the Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem (decomposing vectors as y = ŷ + z where ŷ ∈ W and z ∈ W⊥) and the Best Approximation Theorem (proving ŷ is the unique closest vector in W to y using the Pythagorean theorem). The material includes the practical projection matrix formula proj_W(y) = UU^T y for orthonormal bases, with extensive worked examples demonstrating decompositions, distance calculations, and basis computations in ℝ³ and ℝ⁴. The diagrams subfolder contains four carefully designed geometric visualizations illustrating projection onto 1D subspaces, orthogonal decomposition into W and W⊥ components, and the triangle inequality proof for the Best Approximation Theorem.
