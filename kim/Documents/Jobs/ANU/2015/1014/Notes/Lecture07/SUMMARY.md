# Lecture07

## Overview

Seventh lecture on linear independence and bases for abstract vector spaces in MATH1014 (Second Semester 2015). The lecture transitions from concrete Euclidean spaces to abstract vector spaces, covering formal definitions of linear independence, spanning sets, and basis sets. Topics include the spanning set theorem, algorithms for finding bases for null spaces and column spaces of matrices, the unique representation theorem, and coordinate systems with respect to different bases. The lecture includes worked examples with polynomial spaces and matrices, building on material from prerequisite course MATH1013.
