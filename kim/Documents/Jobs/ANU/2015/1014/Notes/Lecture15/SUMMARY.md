# Lecture15

## Overview

Fifteenth lecture on matrix diagonalization for MATH1014 (2015), focusing on advanced diagonalization theory and worked examples. The lecture explores the Diagonalization Theorem in depth, examines several examples including non-diagonalizable matrices, presents a comprehensive theorem relating eigenspace dimensions to multiplicity, and establishes the connection between diagonalization and change of basis from eigenvector coordinates to standard coordinates. Generated PDFs include clean slides (159KB) and annotated scribble version (1.5MB).
