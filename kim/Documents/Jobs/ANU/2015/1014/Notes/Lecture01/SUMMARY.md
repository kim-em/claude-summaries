# Lecture01

## Overview

First lecture of MATH1014 (Mathematics and Applications 2) covering administrative information and introductory linear algebra content. The lecture is split into two major parts: first, a comprehensive administrative overview of the course structure, assessment, and resources; second, an introduction to coordinates, vectors, and geometry in 3-dimensional space (ℝ³). Topics include the distance formula, surfaces (spheres and planes), vector notation and operations (addition, scalar multiplication), standard basis vectors, and applications to velocity problems and geometric proofs. The lecture is supported by 42 carefully crafted diagrams created in OmniGraffle, illustrating 3D coordinate systems (including right-hand rule mnemonics), vector addition via parallelogram law, navigation/velocity problems with trigonometric angles, and plane intersections in 3D space.
