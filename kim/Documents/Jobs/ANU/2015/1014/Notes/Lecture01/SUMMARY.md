# Lecture01

## Overview

First lecture of MATH1014 (Mathematics and Applications 2) covering administrative information and introductory linear algebra content. The lecture is split into two major parts: first, a comprehensive administrative overview of the course structure, assessment, and resources; second, an introduction to coordinates, vectors, and geometry in 3-dimensional space (ℝ³). Topics include the distance formula, surfaces (spheres and planes), vector notation and operations (addition, scalar multiplication), standard basis vectors, and applications to velocity problems and geometric proofs.
