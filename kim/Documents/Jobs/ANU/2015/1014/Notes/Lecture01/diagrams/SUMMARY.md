# diagrams

## Overview

Vector graphics and illustrations for MATH1014 Lecture 1, created in OmniGraffle and exported to PDF/PNG formats. The diagrams visualize foundational concepts in 3D coordinate systems and vector operations, including the right-hand rule for axes, coordinate system orientation, vector addition using the parallelogram law, navigation/velocity problems (travelling north vs. east with angles), 2D vector plotting with coordinates, and plane intersections in 3D space. Each concept typically has both a source .graffle file and exported PDF, with some diagrams also exported as PNG for different use cases.
