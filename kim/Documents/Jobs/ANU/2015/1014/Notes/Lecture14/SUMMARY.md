# Lecture14

## Overview

Fourteenth lecture in MATH1014 (Second Semester 2015) focusing on matrix diagonalization. The lecture begins with a review of eigenvalues and eigenvectors from Lecture 13, then explores the central question "when is a matrix similar to a diagonal matrix?" Topics include the advantages of diagonal matrices, the diagonalization theorem A = PDP⁻¹, using similarity to compute matrix powers A^k, and the connection between diagonalization and eigenvectors (where P's columns are eigenvectors and D contains corresponding eigenvalues). The material is from Lay §5.3.
