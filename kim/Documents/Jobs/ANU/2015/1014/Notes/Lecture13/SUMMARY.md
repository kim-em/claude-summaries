# Lecture13

## Overview

Thirteenth lecture on eigenvalues and eigenvectors for MATH1014 Linear Algebra, focusing on the characteristic equation as the primary method for finding eigenvalues. The lecture covers the derivation of det(A - λI) = 0, computation examples from 2×2 to 5×5 matrices including triangular matrices, similarity transformations and their preservation of eigenvalues, and applications to dynamical systems and Markov chains with two worked population migration examples. Includes discussion of algebraic multiplicity and numerical computation challenges for matrices n ≥ 5. The supporting diagrams folder contains Maple worksheets with concrete computational examples demonstrating eigenvalue computations for 3×3 matrices with repeated eigenvalues (algebraic multiplicity 2), providing students with worked examples of the numerical techniques discussed in the theoretical lecture content.
