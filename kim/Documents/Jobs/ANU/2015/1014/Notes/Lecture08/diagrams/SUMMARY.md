## Overview

Visual diagrams illustrating coordinate systems and change of basis concepts for Lecture 8. Contains three PDF figures showing (1) the abstract coordinate mapping from a vector space V to ℝⁿ, (2) side-by-side comparison of standard versus B-coordinate representations of a vector x, and (3) a variant showing the special case where b₁ = e₁. These diagrams visually demonstrate how the same vector appears in different coordinate systems depending on the choice of basis.

| `ex0801.pdf` | Figure 5 showing the coordinate mapping from vector space V onto ℝⁿ, illustrating how a vector x in V with basis B maps to its coordinate vector [x]_B in ℝⁿ (111KB) |
| `la0800.pdf` | Side-by-side comparison of standard graph paper (with standard basis e₁, e₂) and B-graph paper (with alternate basis b₁, b₂), showing how the same vector x appears in both coordinate systems (260KB) |
| `la0801.pdf` | Variant of la0800 showing the special case where the alternate basis has b₁ = e₁, demonstrating partial alignment between standard and alternate coordinate systems (15KB) |
