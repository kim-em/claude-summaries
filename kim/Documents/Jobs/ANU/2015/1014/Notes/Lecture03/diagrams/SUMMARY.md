## Overview

Supporting vector graphics for Lecture 3 on lines and planes in ℝ³. Contains OmniGraffle source files (.graffle) for creating 3D geometric diagrams, exported PDFs for inclusion in LaTeX slides, and a PNG illustration of the right-hand rule for cross products. Diagrams illustrate vector equations for planes (with normal vectors), parametric equations for lines (with direction vectors), and the geometric relationship between position vectors r₀, r, and r-r₀.
