# Lecture03

## Overview

Third lecture covering lines and planes in Euclidean space. The lecture introduces vector and parametric equations for lines in ℝ² and ℝ³, symmetric equations using direction numbers, and vector/scalar equations for planes using normal vectors. Topics include determining line intersections, finding direction vectors via cross products, and computing plane equations from three points. Builds directly on dot and cross product operations from Lecture 2.
