# Lecture03

## Overview

Third lecture covering lines and planes in Euclidean space, building directly on dot and cross product operations from Lecture 2. The lecture introduces vector and parametric equations for lines in ℝ² and ℝ³, symmetric equations using direction numbers, and vector/scalar equations for planes using normal vectors. Topics include determining line intersections, finding direction vectors via cross products, and computing plane equations from three points. The lecture is supported by professionally crafted 3D geometric diagrams created in OmniGraffle, illustrating normal vectors to planes, direction vectors along lines, and the right-hand rule for cross products.
