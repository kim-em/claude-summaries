# Lecture09

## Overview

Ninth lecture on dimension theory for vector spaces in MATH1014 linear algebra. Covers the formal definition of dimension as the number of vectors in a basis, the relationship between dimension and rank, and the fundamental Rank Theorem which states that rank(A) + dim(Nul A) = n for an m×n matrix. The lecture introduces row spaces as the third fundamental matrix subspace alongside null space and column space, proving that dim(Row A) = dim(Col A) = rank(A). Applications include solving system solvability questions and extending the Invertible Matrix Theorem with rank-based equivalences. Features a sophisticated example using Hermite polynomials from Schrödinger's quantum harmonic oscillator equation to demonstrate basis verification via the Basis Theorem.
