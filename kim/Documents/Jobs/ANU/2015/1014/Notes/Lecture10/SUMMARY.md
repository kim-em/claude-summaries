# Lecture10

## Overview

Tenth lecture on applications of linear algebra to Markov chains (Lay §4.9), covering probabilistic models for state transitions through discrete time steps. The lecture develops the theory of stochastic matrices and steady-state vectors, with detailed examples including bird movement in a three-level aviary, weather prediction in the Land of Oz, and rat behavior in a three-compartment cage. Includes rigorous treatment of regular stochastic matrices and the convergence theorem guaranteeing unique steady states for predictable long-term behavior.
