# Lecture25

## Overview

Final lecture material for MATH1014 Linear Algebra containing comprehensive revision questions and solutions covering the entire semester's content. The folder includes 13 problems spanning change of basis, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, diagonalization, complex eigenvalues, dynamical systems, orthogonal projections, Markov chains, linear transformations on abstract vector spaces (M₂×₂ and P₂), and differential operators. Complete worked solutions with detailed explanations are provided in both LaTeX source and compiled PDF. The 3.5MB scribble PDF likely contains handwritten lecture notes or problem-solving demonstrations.
