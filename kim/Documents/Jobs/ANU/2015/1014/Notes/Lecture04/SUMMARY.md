# Lecture04

## Overview

Fourth lecture on distances in ℝ³, covering geometric relationships between points, lines, and planes. The main lecture file (11KB) develops formulas for computing distances: point-to-plane using scalar projection, point-to-line using cross product magnitude, and distance between two lines (parallel case using cross product, skew lines case using triple scalar product). The examples file (25KB) is a comprehensive supplement containing 12 worked examples and 16 exercises with full solutions, covering applied vector problems (forces on skydivers, aircraft navigation, tension in wires, torque), geometric computations (intersecting planes and lines, perpendicular conditions), and distance calculations.
