# Lecture04

## Overview

Fourth lecture on distances in ℝ³, developing formulas for computing geometric distances between points, lines, and planes. The main lecture file derives three key distance formulas: point-to-plane using scalar projection onto normal vectors, point-to-line using cross product magnitude and perpendicular projection, and line-to-line distances distinguishing parallel (cross product method) from skew line cases (triple scalar product). A comprehensive 25KB examples supplement provides 12 worked problems spanning applied vector physics (skydiver forces, aircraft navigation, tension analysis, torque calculations) and pure geometric computations (line/plane intersections, perpendicularity conditions), plus 16 additional practice exercises with full solutions. The diagrams subdirectory contains 25 professionally crafted vector diagrams in multiple formats (OmniGraffle sources, PDFs, PNGs, EPS, MS Word sources) illustrating both theoretical distance concepts and specific worked examples from the exercises.
