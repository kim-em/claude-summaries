## Overview

Supporting diagrams and illustrations for Lecture 4 on distances in ℝ³. Contains vector geometry diagrams for theoretical concepts (point-to-plane distance, point-to-line distance, parallel and skew lines) as well as worked example illustrations (skydiver forces, wagon pulling, torque on wrench, line intersections). Files exist in multiple formats: original OmniGraffle sources (.graffle), Microsoft Word sources (.doc), exported PDFs, PNGs, and EPS. The three PNG files specifically illustrate the distance formulas covered in the lecture: distance between parallel lines, distance from point to line, and distance between skew lines.
