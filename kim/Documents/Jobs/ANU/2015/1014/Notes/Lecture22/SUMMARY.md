# Lecture22

## Overview

Twenty-second lecture on the Gram-Schmidt process and QR matrix factorization. The lecture covers orthogonal projection review, the systematic Gram-Schmidt algorithm for converting arbitrary bases into orthogonal bases, normalization to produce orthonormal bases, and QR decomposition for matrices with linearly independent columns. Includes six detailed worked examples demonstrating the process for various subspaces and practical computation of QR factorizations.
