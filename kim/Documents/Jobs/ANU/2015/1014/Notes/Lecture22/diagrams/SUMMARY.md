## Overview

Visual diagrams supporting Lecture 22 on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization and QR factorization. Contains geometric illustrations of the Gram-Schmidt process in 3D, showing the orthogonalization of basis vectors, plus a series of diagrams illustrating least squares solutions through orthogonal projection onto column spaces.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GramSchm.png` | 3D geometric diagram illustrating the Gram-Schmidt process: shows how vector x₂ is orthogonalized against x₁ to produce v₂, with the span{x₁,x₂} plane visualized (49KB) |
| `ex1.pdf` | Alternative view of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization showing the relationship between original basis vectors x₁, x₂ and orthogonal vectors v₁, v₂ in a 3D coordinate system (44KB) |
| `leastsq0.png` | Geometric interpretation of least squares: shows vector b, its projection Ax̂ onto Col A, and the residual vector Ax̂y perpendicular to the column space (35KB) |
| `leastsq1.png` | Simplified least squares diagram showing b, its projection b̂=Ax̂ onto Col A, and the residual z perpendicular to the column space (29KB) |
| `leastsq2.png` | Final least squares diagram emphasizing the orthogonality: shows b, the projection Ax̂=b̂ in Col A, and the residual b-Ax̂ perpendicular to the column space (31KB) |
