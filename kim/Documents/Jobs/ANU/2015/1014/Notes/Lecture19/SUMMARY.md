# Lecture19

## Overview

Nineteenth lecture introducing inner products and orthogonality in Euclidean spaces (Lay §6.1, 6.2), transitioning from dynamical systems to the final course topic. The lecture revisits the dot product definition and properties from ℝ³, extends to ℝⁿ, and develops fundamental concepts of orthogonality including orthogonal complements, the relationship between row/column spaces and null spaces, and decomposition of vectors into orthogonal components. This establishes groundwork for least-squares solutions to inconsistent linear systems arising from experimental data, motivating orthogonal projections as tools for finding approximate solutions.
