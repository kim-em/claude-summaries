## Overview

Visual assets supporting Lecture 18 on discrete dynamical systems and eigenvalue theory. Contains 16 diagrams divided into two categories: mathematical phase portraits showing trajectory behavior for different eigenvalue cases (attractor, repellor, saddle point, spiral dynamics with multiple variants), and ecological illustrations for the predator-prey examples used in the lecture (woodrat, spotted owl, and predator-prey interaction photographs). The mathematical diagrams visualize how eigenvalue magnitudes and complex eigenvalues determine long-term system behavior in 2D phase space.
