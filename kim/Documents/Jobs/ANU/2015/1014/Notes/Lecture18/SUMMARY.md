# Lecture18

## Overview

Eighteenth lecture on discrete linear dynamical systems (x_{k+1} = Ax_k), applying eigenvalue theory to model time-evolving systems in ecology and population dynamics. The lecture explores how eigenvalue magnitudes determine long-term behavior (attractors, repellors, saddle points, spiral dynamics) with extensive worked examples including owl/woodrat predator-prey systems, buffalo herd survival, and spotted owl population modeling. This 23KB LaTeX source generates presentation slides and handouts with 16 supporting diagrams visualizing phase portraits and trajectories for different eigenvalue cases.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MATH1014-LinearAlgebra-Lecture18.tex` | Main LaTeX source for lecture on discrete dynamical systems: theoretical framework (diagonalizable matrices, eigenvalue decomposition), predator-prey examples (owl/rat populations with varying predation rates p=0.104, 0.2, 0.125), graphical trajectory analysis for 2×2 matrices (attractors, repellors, saddle points), complex eigenvalue cases (spiral attractors/repellors, orbital centres), and applied examples (buffalo herd demographics, spotted owl survival models) (23KB) |
| `MATH1014-LinearAlgebra-Lecture18.pdf` | Compiled beamer presentation slides (519KB, generated from .tex source via makefile) |
| `MATH1014-LinearAlgebra-Lecture18.scribble.pdf` | Annotated/scribbled version of the lecture slides, likely with handwritten notes added during presentation (3.1MB) |
