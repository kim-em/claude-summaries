# Lecture18

## Overview

Eighteenth lecture on discrete linear dynamical systems (x_{k+1} = Ax_k), applying eigenvalue theory to model time-evolving systems in ecology and population dynamics. The lecture explores how eigenvalue magnitudes and complex eigenvalues determine long-term behavior (attractors, repellors, saddle points, spiral dynamics) with extensive worked examples including owl/woodrat predator-prey systems with varying predation rates (p=0.104, 0.2, 0.125), buffalo herd demographics, and spotted owl population modeling. The comprehensive visual support includes 16 diagrams: mathematical phase portraits showing trajectory behavior for all eigenvalue cases (attractor, repellor, saddle, spiral, double eigenvalue, complex with magnitude ≈1), and ecological photographs illustrating the predator-prey relationship (woodrat prey, spotted owl predators, hunting scene). This 23KB LaTeX source generates both beamer presentation slides and annotated handouts using the course's shared build system.
