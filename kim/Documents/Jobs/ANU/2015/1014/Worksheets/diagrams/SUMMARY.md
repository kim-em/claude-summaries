## Overview

Supporting diagrams for MATH1014 linear algebra worksheets. Contains a single geometric diagram illustrating the point-to-line distance problem from the Week 02 worksheet. The diagram shows a 3D coordinate system with a line, a point, and the geometric construction for finding the perpendicular distance using vector methods and angles.
