# 1014

## Overview

Complete teaching archive for MATH1014 (Mathematics and Applications 1) Semester 2 2015 at ANU, documenting Dr. Scott Morrison's comprehensive first-year linear algebra course taught to ~280 students. This folder represents a full-cycle teaching record from planning through assessment, containing 25 professional lectures progressing from concrete vectors in ℝ³ through abstract vector space theory to advanced topics (eigenvalues, diagonalization, orthogonality, least squares, Markov chains, SVD), 11 weekly tutorial worksheets with solutions, complete examination materials (mid-semester, final, and supplementary exams with detailed solutions and study guides), detailed attendance analysis correlating participation with performance, comprehensive grading records, confidential student accommodation plans (EAP), timetabling logistics, and even a jokes collection for classroom engagement.

The course builds on substantial historical resources: the OldMaterial folder contains Joan Licata's previous offerings (2013-2015) with 23 Beamer lectures, 28 Maple computational worksheets using custom `laylinalg` package, complete exam collections, WebAssign quizzes, and tutorial materials—a rich pedagogical foundation that informed Morrison's adaptation. The sophisticated LaTeX infrastructure (custom document classes, shared notation macros, automated make/latexmk builds, over 200 geometric diagrams, web deployment to tqft.net) enabled professional presentation materials and efficient iteration. Student support included past exam solutions, EAP accommodations for five students (disability adjustments and elite athlete plans), and supplementary assessments for borderline cases. Administrative rigor is evidenced by detailed attendance tracking, grade correlation analysis, staff availability matrices, and enrollment variation documentation—this is not merely teaching materials but a complete record of course delivery, student support, and pedagogical evolution.
