# OldMaterial

## Overview

Archive of teaching materials from previous offerings of MATH1014, primarily from Semester 1 2015 and earlier years. This folder serves as a historical repository containing exam papers, lecture materials, quizzes, and worksheets from past iterations of the course. The materials appear to include content from both the instructor's own previous teaching (Semester 1 2015) and inherited materials from other instructors (notably "JEL" - Jill E. Lawrence based on directory naming). These archived materials likely served as reference and source material when preparing the Semester 2 2015 course materials in the parent directory.
