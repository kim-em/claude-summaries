# OldMaterial

## Overview

Comprehensive archive of MATH1014 teaching materials from previous course offerings, primarily Semester 1 2013-2015, providing rich source material for Scott Morrison's Semester 2 2015 course adaptation. This folder contains a complete pedagogical ecosystem inherited from Joan Licata (JEL): 23 lectures of professionally-developed linear algebra content structured around Lay's textbook, complete examination materials (2014-2015 mid-semester and finals with solutions), weekly online quizzes from the WebAssign system, and tutorial worksheets covering the full syllabus. The lecture materials are particularly comprehensive, featuring Beamer presentations, LaTeX source, extensive computational support via 28 Maple worksheets using a custom `laylinalg` package, and application-focused case studies linking theory to cryptography, network analysis, and dynamical systems. The materials demonstrate modern pedagogical approaches combining geometric intuition, abstract theory, computational exploration, and real-world applications, making this folder a valuable historical record and reusable resource for future course iterations.
