# WebAssignQuizzes

## Overview

Collection of ten online quiz PDFs from the WebAssign homework system used in MATH1014 Semester 1 2015. These quizzes cover the full range of course topics including vector geometry, numerical integration methods, coordinate systems, matrix rank and basis concepts, infinite series, convergence tests, and power series. Each quiz contains 10-11 questions worth 1 point each (total 10 points), with strict submission rules (multiple choice questions allow only one submission, other questions allow three attempts). Students were required to maintain written workings in their workbooks for tutor review, with quiz marks contingent on satisfactory documentation. Quiz author was Joan Licata (joan.licata@anu.edu.au).
