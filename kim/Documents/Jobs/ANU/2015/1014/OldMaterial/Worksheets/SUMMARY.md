# Worksheets

## Overview

Collection of tutorial worksheets from previous MATH1014 offerings covering various topics in linear algebra, vectors, and calculus. The folder contains numbered weekly worksheets (Weeks 1-10, 12) with corresponding solution sets, plus specialized materials including a Matrix Workshop with solutions and a Transformation Summary reference guide. All materials are provided in both LaTeX source and compiled PDF formats, allowing for future editing and reuse. The worksheets appear to follow Stewart's textbook sections and progress through topics like vector operations, dot products, eigenvalues, diagonalization, and series convergence.
