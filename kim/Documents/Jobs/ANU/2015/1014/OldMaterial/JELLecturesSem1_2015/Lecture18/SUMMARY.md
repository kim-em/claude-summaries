# Lecture18

## Overview

Lecture 20 materials on inner products and orthogonality (Lay §6.1-6.2). This lecture begins the final major topic of the course: orthogonality and its applications to least squares solutions. Topics include dot product review, vector length and normalization, orthogonal vectors and complements, and the fundamental theorem relating row/column spaces to null spaces. The lecture motivates inner products through practical applications (least squares solutions for overdetermined systems) and geometric understanding of abstract vector spaces. Includes both standard Beamer slides and a print-friendly 4-on-1 version with recommended exercises.
