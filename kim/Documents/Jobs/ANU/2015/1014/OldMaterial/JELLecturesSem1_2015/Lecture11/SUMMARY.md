# Lecture11

## Overview

Lecture materials for "Lecture 13" covering applications of linear algebra to Markov chains (from Lay §4.9). The folder contains duplicate LaTeX source files (Lecture10.tex and Lecture11.tex with identical content), Beamer presentation slides in both regular and print versions for both LA10 and LA11, and supporting materials including a diagram of a three-compartment rat cage experiment (la1303.pdf) and a vases PNG image. Despite being in the "Lecture11" folder, the content is labeled as "Lecture 13" and covers stochastic matrices, probability vectors, steady-state vectors, and applications including the aviary example, Land of Oz weather patterns, and rat behavior experiments.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
