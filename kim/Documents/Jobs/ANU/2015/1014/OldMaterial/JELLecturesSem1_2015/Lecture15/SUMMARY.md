# Lecture15

## Overview

Lecture 17 materials on matrix representations of linear transformations relative to different bases (Lay §5.4). This lecture bridges the gap between abstract linear transformations and concrete matrix computations by showing how choice of basis affects matrix representation. The materials cover: standard matrices for linear transformations, the general algorithm for finding the matrix [T]_CB of a transformation T:V→W relative to bases B and C, and the connection between diagonalization and finding diagonal matrix representations. Two versions exist: "class" version (Lecture15class.tex) for in-class presentation and "post" version (Lecture15post.tex) with additional worked examples for online posting. Includes Beamer presentations in both regular and print (4-up handout) formats.
