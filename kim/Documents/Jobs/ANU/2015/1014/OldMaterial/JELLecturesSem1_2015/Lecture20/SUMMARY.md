# Lecture20

## Overview

Materials for Lecture 22 (note: folder name is "Lecture20" but content is labeled Lecture 22) covering orthogonal projections onto subspaces (Lay §6.3). The lecture generalizes the notion of projecting one vector onto another to projecting vectors onto arbitrary subspaces of ℝⁿ. Topics include the Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem, computing projections using orthogonal/orthonormal bases, the Best Approximation Theorem, distance from a point to a subspace, and matrix formulas for orthogonal projection (proj_W y = UU^T y). Includes LaTeX source, Beamer presentations (regular and print versions), and four geometric diagram PDFs illustrating projection concepts.
