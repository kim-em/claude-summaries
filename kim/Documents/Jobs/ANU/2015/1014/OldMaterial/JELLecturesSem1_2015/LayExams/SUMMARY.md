# LayExams

## Overview

Collection of practice exam problems and solutions from David C. Lay's "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" textbook, organized by exam type (Second Exam, Third Exam, and Final Exam). The materials include both exam questions (stdex*) and detailed solutions (stdsol*), with multiple versions indicated by letter suffixes (a, b, c). These supplementary materials provided students with additional practice problems aligned with the MATH1014 linear algebra course content, covering topics such as vector spaces, LU factorization, determinants, subspaces, eigenvalues, quadratic forms, and applications like Markov chains and least-squares fitting.
