# Lecture22-REDO!

## Overview

Revised materials for Lecture 24 (confusingly named "Lecture22-REDO") covering the Least Squares Problem in linear algebra. This folder contains LaTeX source files, Beamer presentation slides (both regular and print versions), and supporting PDF diagrams. The lecture introduces methods for finding approximate solutions to inconsistent linear systems using the least squares approach, normal equations, and orthogonal projection onto column spaces (from Lay §6.5). The "REDO" designation indicates this is a revised or corrected version of earlier lecture materials.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Lecture22.tex` | Primary LaTeX source for Lecture 24 on least squares: definitions, normal equations (A^T A x = A^T b), theorems, worked examples, and QR factorization alternative |
| `Lecture22c.tex` | Variant/corrected version of Lecture22.tex with nearly identical content (16,807 bytes vs 16,798 bytes) |
| `LA22Beamer.tex` | Main Beamer presentation wrapper including Lecture22c.tex for slide display |
| `LA22BeamerPrint.tex` | Handout version of Beamer slides configured for 4-on-1 printing on A4 landscape, includes recommended exercises (Lay 6.5: 3, 9, 11) |
| `LA23Notes.tex` | Article-style notes wrapper referencing Lecture24 (likely an alternate lecture numbering scheme) |
| `LA22Beamer.pdf` | Compiled Beamer presentation on least squares (270 KB, slide format) |
| `LA22BeamerPrint.pdf` | Compiled handout version with 4 slides per page (204 KB) |
| `LA22Beamer.idx` | LaTeX index file (empty) for Beamer presentation compilation |
| `LA22BeamerPrint.idx` | LaTeX index file (empty) for print version compilation |
| `leastsq0.png` | Diagram showing geometric interpretation: seeking x-hat such that Ax-hat is closest point to b in Col(A) |
| `leastsq1.png` | Diagram illustrating orthogonal projection: b-hat is closest point to b in Col(A), requiring Ax-hat = b-hat |
| `leastsq2.png` | Diagram showing that requiring b - Ax-hat orthogonal to Col(A) leads to normal equations |
| `bestfit.pdf` | Supporting diagram or example (51 KB) |
| `ex01.pdf` | Exercise or example diagram 1 (35 KB) |
| `ex02.pdf` | Exercise or example diagram 2 (31 KB) |
| `la2401.pdf` | Additional reference or example material (15 KB) |
