# Lecture04

## Overview

Lecture 4 materials covering geometric distances in R³, including formulas and methods for computing distances between points, lines, and planes in three-dimensional space. The lecture builds on the vector equations introduced in Lecture 3, applying dot product and cross product identities to derive distance formulas. Topics include point-to-plane distance, point-to-line distance, and distances between lines (both parallel and skew cases). Materials include Beamer presentation slides, comprehensive worked examples with applications to physics and engineering, workshop exercises, and numerous diagrams illustrating geometric concepts.
