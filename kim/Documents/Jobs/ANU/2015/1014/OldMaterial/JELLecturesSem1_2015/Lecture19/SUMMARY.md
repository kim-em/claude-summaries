# Lecture19

## Overview

Lecture 21 materials on orthogonal sets, orthogonal bases, and orthonormal sets (Lay §6.2). The lecture extends the concept of orthogonality from vectors and subspaces to sets of vectors, introducing orthogonal and orthonormal bases for subspaces. Key theorems establish that orthogonal sets of nonzero vectors are linearly independent and provide formulas for computing coordinates with respect to orthogonal bases. The materials include full presentations with detailed proofs and worked examples on finding orthogonal complements, computing coordinates in orthogonal bases, and constructing orthogonal matrices.
