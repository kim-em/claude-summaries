# Lecture09*(redo)

## Overview

Lecture 9/10 materials covering dimension theory and the rank theorem in linear algebra. The content focuses on defining dimension for finite-dimensional vector spaces, exploring the relationship between dimension and bases, and developing the rank theorem that relates the dimensions of null space, column space, and row space of a matrix. This folder is marked "(redo)" suggesting it contains revised versions of the original lecture materials. Interestingly, the main LaTeX source is titled "Lecture 10" while the Beamer presentations are titled "LA9", indicating this lecture bridges content between Lectures 9 and 10.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Lecture9.tex` | Main LaTeX content file containing complete lecture material on dimension, bases, rank theorem, and applications to systems of equations (from Lay §4.5-4.6) |
| `LA9Beamer.tex` | Beamer presentation driver file that includes Lecture9.tex for slideshow format |
| `LA9Beamer.pdf` | Compiled Beamer presentation slides (417KB, full presentation with overlays) |
| `LA9BeamerPrint.tex` | Print-optimized version of Beamer presentation (likely without overlays/pauses) |
| `LA9BeamerPrint.pdf` | Compiled print version of slides (224KB, smaller due to fewer overlays) |
| `LA10Notes.tex` | Article-format driver file for notes that includes Lecture10 material (note the naming discrepancy) |
| `LA9Beamer.idx` | Empty LaTeX index file (auxiliary build file for Beamer presentation) |
