## Overview

Comprehensive collection of 28 Maple worksheet files (.mws) providing computational case studies and exercises for MATH1014 Linear Algebra. These worksheets demonstrate practical applications of linear algebra concepts using Maple's computational capabilities, covering topics from the Lay textbook including network flow, cryptography, economics, numerical methods, and dynamical systems. Each worksheet includes interactive Maple code with exercises and explanations, utilizing the custom `laylinalg` package. The worksheets range from small focused examples (12-75 KB) to extensive computational demonstrations (up to 4 MB for `currents.mws` and 1.4 MB for `adjacency.mws` and `case7.mws`).
