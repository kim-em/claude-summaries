# CaseStudies

## Overview

Collection of application-oriented case study materials for linear algebra instruction, focusing on real-world applications that demonstrate practical uses of matrix operations, vector spaces, eigenvalues, and other core concepts. The materials include detailed exercises on cryptography (Hill cipher), error-correcting codes (Hamming codes), Fibonacci sequences and difference equations, and singular value decomposition (SVD). Most case studies are formatted as structured problem sets with theoretical explanations, worked examples, and student exercises, sourced from or referencing Lay's Linear Algebra textbook (sections 4.1, 4.6, 5.3). These materials align with the MATH1014 curriculum covered in the parent lecture series.
