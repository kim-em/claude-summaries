# David

## Overview

A small collection of lecture materials for MATH1014 Linear Algebra, containing two lectures on Markov chains and eigenvectors/eigenvalues. The folder name suggests these materials may have been contributed by a different instructor or teaching assistant (David). The materials use Joan Licata's beamer preamble but have custom content for lectures 13 and 14. This appears to be a parallel or alternative version of some lecture materials, as Lecture13 and Lecture14 directories exist separately in the parent folder.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LA11.tex` | LaTeX source for Lecture 13 on "Applications to Markov chains" from Lay §4.9, covering stochastic matrices, probability vectors, steady-state vectors, and examples including bird aviary model and Land of Oz weather patterns |
| `LA12.tex` | LaTeX source for Lecture 14 on "Eigenvectors and eigenvalues" from Lay §5.1, covering definitions, eigenspaces, eigenvalues of triangular matrices, and worked examples |
| `LA12.pdf` | Compiled 28-page Beamer presentation slides for the eigenvectors/eigenvalues lecture (181KB) |
| `beamer-preamble.tex` | Custom Beamer preamble configuration (Boadilla theme, author: Joan Licata, Semester 1 2013) - similar to parent directory's version |
| `la1303.pdf` | Small diagram (1 page, 7KB) showing a three-compartment rat cage setup used as example in Markov chain lecture |
| `LA11.idx` | Empty LaTeX index file for LA11 |
| `LA12.idx` | Empty LaTeX index file for LA12 |
