# Lecture21

## Overview

Materials for Lecture 23 on the Gram-Schmidt process and QR factorization (Lay §6.4). This lecture reviews orthogonal projection and introduces the Gram-Schmidt algorithm for converting an arbitrary basis into an orthogonal/orthonormal basis. The materials include detailed worked examples showing how to orthogonalize bases for subspaces, compute orthonormal bases, and find QR decompositions of matrices. The lecture also includes visualizations of the geometric intuition behind Gram-Schmidt and least squares projections. This is a leaf folder with no subdirectories.
