# Revision

## Overview

Comprehensive revision materials for MATH1014 linear algebra course, providing practice problems covering the full course content. Contains three parallel documents: question sheet (RevisionQ), detailed solutions (RevisionSols), and a single worked example on complex eigenvalues (Revision). Problems span change of basis, eigenvalue computation, diagonalization, dynamical systems, complex eigenvalues, orthogonal projections, orthogonal matrices, Markov chains, and linear transformations on abstract vector spaces (matrix spaces and polynomial spaces). These materials complement the LectureRevision folder which focuses on 2013 exam problems.
