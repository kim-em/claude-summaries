# JELLecturesSem1_2015

## Overview

Complete lecture materials from Joan Licata's Semester 1 2013/2015 offering of MATH1014 (Mathematics and Applications 2 - Algebra). This comprehensive collection contains LaTeX source files for all lectures, Beamer presentation slides, case studies, and Maple computational examples. The materials cover linear algebra topics including vectors, vector spaces, linear independence, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, orthogonality, and applications to Markov chains and difference equations. The directory includes both individual lecture materials (Lecture01 through Lecture23Applications plus revision materials) and supplementary resources. Note that course.tex indicates these were later reused/modified for Scott Morrison's Semester 2 2015 offering.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Notes.tex` | Main LaTeX document that compiles all lecture notes into a single PDF booklet for "Math1014 Linear Algebra Notes 2012 Semester 1" |
| `RobertsInfo.tex` | Course information Beamer presentation including syllabus, textbook requirements (Lay's Linear Algebra), WebAssign quiz system, and resource links |
| `course.tex` | Course metadata defining instructor (Dr Scott Morrison), institution (ANU), and timing (Second Semester 2015) - updated from original JEL version |
| `beamer-preamble.tex` | Common Beamer presentation configuration using Boadilla theme, shared across all lecture slides |
| `local-defs.tex` | LaTeX macro definitions for mathematical notation (vectors, spaces, operators) used throughout all lecture materials |
