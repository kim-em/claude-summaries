# Lecture23Applications

## Overview

Final lecture materials (Lecture 24) showcasing diverse applications of linear algebra concepts taught throughout MATH1014. The lecture presents four real-world applications spanning pure mathematics, computer science, psychology, and signal processing: Fourier analysis with orthonormal bases of trigonometric functions, algebraic topology using homology vector spaces and eigenvalue constraints, Google's PageRank algorithm as an iterative linear system, and dimensional reduction in personality testing (Myers-Briggs). Materials include LaTeX source, Beamer presentations (standard and print versions with 4-on-1 layout), and topology diagrams illustrating curves on surfaces, isotopy equivalence, and band stabilization.

| `LA23Beamer.tex` | Beamer presentation wrapper including course settings and beamer-preamble for standard slide format |
| `LA23Beamer.pdf` | Compiled Beamer presentation slides (1.1 MB) for Lecture 24 applications |
| `LA23BeamerPrint.tex` | Print-optimized Beamer wrapper using handout mode with 4-on-1 pgfpages layout for efficient printing |
| `LA23BeamerPrint.pdf` | Compiled print version (1.1 MB) with four slides per page in landscape format |
| `isotopy.pdf` | Topology diagram showing two curves on a surface (red bands on light blue disc) demonstrating isotopy equivalence - curves can be continuously deformed into each other |
| `isotopy2.pdf` | Surface construction diagram showing bands attached to a disc with red segments marking basis vectors for relative first homology H₁ |
| `isotopy3.pdf` | Simplified view after pushing curves to boundary, demonstrating that original segments form a basis for the homology vector space |
