# LectureRevision

## Overview

Comprehensive exam revision materials for MATH1014 Linear Algebra, including worked solutions to 2013 Mid-Semester Exam problems. Contains LaTeX source for revision lectures, compiled Beamer presentations (regular and print versions), multiple versions of exam PDFs (la1301, la1302, la1303 with variants), Maple computational examples for Markov chain iteration, and a large Italian exam paper (prova.pdf). The revision content covers lines and planes in R³, bases and coordinate systems, vector spaces and subspaces, and matrix subspaces (null space, column space), with detailed step-by-step solutions demonstrating problem-solving techniques.
