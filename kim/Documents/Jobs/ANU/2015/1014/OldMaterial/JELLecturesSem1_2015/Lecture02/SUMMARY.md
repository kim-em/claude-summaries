# Lecture02

## Overview

Second lecture materials for MATH1014 Linear Algebra covering vector products (dot product and cross product). The folder contains LaTeX source files, compiled Beamer presentations (regular and print versions), and supporting graphical resources (PDF diagrams and PNG images). This lecture introduces two fundamental operations on vectors: the dot (scalar) product and the cross (vector) product, including their definitions, geometric interpretations, computational formulas using determinants, and applications to orthogonality, projections, and work calculations. The materials include multiple versions (Lecture02.tex, Lecture02.2015.tex, and Lecture02a.tex), suggesting revisions between different offerings.
