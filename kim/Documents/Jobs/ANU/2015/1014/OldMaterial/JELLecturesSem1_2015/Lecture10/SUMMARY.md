# Lecture10

## Overview

Lecture materials for what appears to be Lecture 11 (based on internal content), introducing eigenvectors and eigenvalues (Lay Section 5.1). The folder exhibits naming confusion with files labeled variously as "Lecture11" and "LA13" (Linear Algebra 13), though housed in the "Lecture10" directory. Content includes comprehensive revision of vector spaces, bases, and geometric concepts before introducing eigenvalue theory. The materials include LaTeX source, Beamer presentations, multiple Maple computational examples demonstrating matrix powers and convergence behavior, Graffle diagrams, and compiled PDF outputs. The Maple worksheets explore matrix iteration with different transition matrices, computing powers like T^7, T^15, and T^20 to demonstrate convergence to steady states.
