# Lecture14

## Overview

Lecture 16 materials on matrix diagonalization from MATH1014 (Mathematics and Applications 2 - Algebra). This lecture introduces the fundamental question "When is a matrix A similar to a diagonal matrix?" and develops the diagonalization theorem, which states that an n×n matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors. The lecture covers the computational advantages of diagonal matrices (easy eigenvalue identification, determinants, and matrix powers), the diagonalization factorization A = PDP⁻¹, and the critical relationship between eigenspaces and diagonalizability. Note: Despite being stored in "Lecture14/" directory, the content is labeled "Lecture 16" throughout, based on Lay §5.3.
