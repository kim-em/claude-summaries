# Lecture17

## Overview

Lecture materials covering discrete dynamical systems (Lay §5.6). The lecture explores linear dynamical systems described by recursive equations $x_{k+1} = Ax_k$, focusing on eigenvalue-based analysis to predict long-term behavior. Content includes predator-prey population models (owl and rat populations with varying predation rates), trajectory analysis, and classification of equilibrium points (attractors, repellors, saddle points, spiral attractors). The folder contains LaTeX source, compiled Beamer presentations (regular and print versions), and numerous PDF diagrams illustrating different trajectory behaviors. Note that while the folder is named Lecture17, the LaTeX source refers to "Lecture 19," indicating potential renumbering in the course sequence.
