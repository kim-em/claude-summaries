# Lecture08

## Overview

Lecture 8 materials on coordinate systems and change of basis transformations in linear algebra. This lecture builds on the previous lecture's introduction to bases by exploring how different bases determine different coordinates for the same vector, introducing the concept of isomorphism between vector spaces, and developing two algorithmic approaches for computing change-of-basis matrices. The lecture includes Beamer presentations (regular and print versions with recommended exercises), article-style notes, and supporting diagrams illustrating coordinate transformations.
