# Lecture05

## Overview

Lecture 5 materials introducing the foundational concepts of abstract vector spaces and subspaces in the MATH1014 Linear Algebra course. This lecture transitions from the concrete geometric study of vectors in Euclidean space to the abstract algebraic framework, covering the ten vector space axioms, examples of vector spaces (matrices, polynomials, functions), and the definition and properties of subspaces. The materials include comprehensive examples showing how to verify vector space axioms and subspace properties, with applications to polynomial spaces, matrix spaces, and column spaces. The lecture follows Section 4.1 of Lay's textbook.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Lecture05.tex` | Main LaTeX content file containing all lecture material: vector space definition with ten axioms, examples (2×2 matrices, polynomials P₂ and Pₙ, integers as counterexample, real functions), subspace definition and examples (symmetric matrices, polynomials with specific values, span construction, column spaces) |
| `LA05Beamer.pdf` | Compiled Beamer presentation slides for classroom delivery (354KB, regular format) |
| `LA05Beamer.tex` | Beamer driver file that includes course.tex, beamer-preamble.tex, and Lecture05.tex to produce presentation slides |
| `LA05BeamerPrint.pdf` | Compiled print version of slides in 4-on-1 handout format for student distribution (204KB) |
| `LA05BeamerPrint.tex` | Beamer driver file for handout mode using pgfpages 4-on-1 layout, includes suggested exercises (Lay §4.1: 3, 9, 13, 33) |
| `LA05Notes.tex` | Article-format driver file using beamerarticle package to compile lecture content as traditional notes rather than slides |

| `quadr3.png` | Diagram showing the first quadrant of the xy-plane (16KB), used for Example 10 demonstrating a set that is NOT a subspace (fails closure under scalar multiplication) |
| `transline1.png` | Diagram of the line y=x+1 (18KB), used for Example 8 showing a line that is NOT a subspace because it doesn't contain the zero vector |
