# Lecture07

## Overview

Lecture 7 materials covering linear independence and bases for abstract vector spaces. This lecture extends the concepts from Euclidean spaces (covered in MATH1013) to general vector spaces, introducing the formal definitions of linearly independent sets, bases, and coordinate systems. The lecture includes detailed examples with polynomial vector spaces and algorithms for finding bases of null spaces and column spaces of matrices. All three standard formats are included: regular Beamer presentation slides, print-friendly 4-on-1 handout version, and article-style notes for the compiled booklet.
