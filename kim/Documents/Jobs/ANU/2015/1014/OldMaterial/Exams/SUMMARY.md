# Exams

## Overview

Complete collection of examination materials for MATH1014 Linear Algebra from the 2014-2015 academic years, including mid-semester and final exams with solutions. The folder contains LaTeX source files and compiled PDFs for both 2014 and 2015 exams, along with exam information sheets, cover pages, and non-collaboration declarations. These materials cover topics from geometry in R³ and matrix operations through eigenvalues, diagonalization, and orthogonal projections, corresponding to Lay Chapter 4-6 and Stewart 10.1-10.5. The exams allowed students one handwritten A4 note sheet and were structured around fundamental linear algebra concepts: vector spaces, subspaces, linear transformations, bases, and computational techniques.
