# 2015

## Overview

Records for 2015 academic year at ANU, including annual report documenting research achievements (AustMS Medal, Christopher Heyde Medal, subfactor classification results), teaching responsibilities (DECRA semester 1, MATH1014 semester 2), supervision of PhD student Cain Edie-Michell and several summer/winter research students, Level D promotion application materials with supporting documents, extensive postdoctoral fellowship hiring committee work for two positions, continuing faculty position selection committee participation, HDR Convenor role, and building committee service. Major research accomplishments include classification of subfactors with index at most 5¼, computing annular Khovanov homology, and extensive international collaboration and travel (Oberwolfach, IPAM, Banff, Beijing, Station Q).
