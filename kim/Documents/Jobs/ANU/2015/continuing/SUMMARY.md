## Overview

Materials from a continuing faculty position selection committee for a statistics/probability role at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute in 2015. Contains individual candidate assessment files for ten external candidates (Bartlett, Goldstein, Koltchinskii, Lugosi, Mossel, Neeman, Taskinen, Verbyla, Xia, Zeitouni), Scott Morrison's summary assessment evaluating all candidates including internal candidates Hui and Portal, and consolidated comments PDF compiling the committee's input. The materials include expert consultations with leading mathematicians and statisticians from Berkeley, USC, and other institutions, evaluating candidates' research strength, teaching performance, independence, and ARC track record.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `summary.txt` | Scott Morrison's comprehensive assessment of all candidates noting Choi, Fang, Tarr as not appropriate; Hui, Lecue, Portal as hirable but concerns about two best candidates being internal (Hui and Portal); praises Portal's ARC track record and work quality; expresses dissatisfaction that internal candidates dominate the shortlist |
| `Bartlett.txt` | Notes from conversation with Peter Bartlett (Berkeley) about Tarr (not very strong), Hui (too early to pick), Guillaume/Lecue (important contributions), Choi (not clearly a star, positive but not over-the-top letters at Berkeley) |
| `Goldstein.txt` | Larry Goldstein's (USC) assessment ranking Sen stronger than Fang for independence and techniques beyond Stein's method; notes Fang's independence growing up with hands-off advisor Louis Chen; Sen-Chatterjee minimal spanning trees paper impressive but authorship contribution unclear |
| `Neeman.txt` | Amnon Neeman's email from Bonn noting Ghosh and Sen are strongest (stronger than Fang), Choi is strongest statistician (young statisticians can get tenure-track right out of PhD), Ghosh being considered for W2 position at Hausdorff Institute |
| `Verbyla.txt` | Ari Verbyla's CV-based assessment preferring Hui (outstanding PhD record, mainstream statistics, likely leading researcher) and Lecue (theoretical, good publications, new directions) over Choi (too early, still in PhD with Tibshirani) |
| `Koltchinskii.txt` | Assessment and consultation notes regarding Vladimir Koltchinskii candidate |
| `Lugosi.txt` | Assessment and consultation notes regarding Gabor Lugosi candidate |
| `Mossel.txt` | Assessment and consultation notes regarding Elchanan Mossel candidate |
| `Taskinen.txt` | Assessment and consultation notes regarding Taskinen candidate |
| `Xia.txt` | Assessment and consultation notes regarding Xia candidate |
| `Zeitouni.txt` | Assessment and consultation notes regarding Ofer Zeitouni candidate |
| `comments.pdf` | Consolidated PDF (54KB) compiling committee comments and assessments across all candidates |
