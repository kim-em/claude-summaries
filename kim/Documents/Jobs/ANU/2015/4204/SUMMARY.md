# 4204

## Overview

MATH4204 Algebraic Topology course materials from 2015, consisting of handwritten lecture notes. Contains Lecture 27 as a standalone document (8 pages) plus a complete compiled set of notes covering lectures 23-36 (77 pages, 2.4MB). Topics progress from computational algebraic topology (cellular homology, Euler characteristic, degree of maps) through categorical foundations (categories, functors, natural transformations) to advanced topics including cohomology theory, cup products, Poincaré duality, higher homotopy groups, and vector bundles.
