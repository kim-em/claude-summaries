# supporting-documents

## Overview

Comprehensive supporting documentation for 2015 Level D promotion application, demonstrating exceptional performance across research, teaching, and service. Research impact is evidenced through citation comparisons with Go8 mathematicians, showing h-index of 9 (equal 6th among all Level D Go8 pure mathematicians since 1996) and h-index of 8 since 2008 (exceeding all Level D peers and ranking equal 5th among all Go8 pure mathematicians), plus 2015 Christopher Heyde Medal in pure mathematics from the Australian Academy of Science. Teaching excellence is demonstrated through voluntary MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours instruction during DECRA fellowship (2013-2014), with course evaluations showing strong student satisfaction (4.3-4.4/5 learning experience, 4.0-4.4/5 teaching quality) and year-over-year improvement. Service contributions are evidenced through MathOverflow co-founder/moderator status (4,438 reputation, appointed 2013). All materials are compiled into a unified supporting documents package for the promotion committee.
