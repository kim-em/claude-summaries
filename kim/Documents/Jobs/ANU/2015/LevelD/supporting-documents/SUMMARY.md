# supporting-documents

## Overview

Supporting documentation for 2015 Level D promotion application including citation comparisons with Go8 mathematicians (h-index analysis from 1996 and 2008), Christopher Heyde Medal award announcement, MATH3325 course materials and evaluations from 2013-2014, evidence of MathOverflow moderator status, and compiled supporting documents package. The materials demonstrate Scott Morrison's exceptional research impact (h-index of 9 ranking 6th among Level D Go8 pure mathematicians, h-index of 8 since 2008 exceeding all Level D peers), teaching excellence (average course evaluations 4.1-4.2 for voluntary MATH3325 teaching), and service contributions (MathOverflow co-founder/moderator with 4,438 reputation).
