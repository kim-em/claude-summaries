# LevelD

## Overview

Complete archive of Scott Morrison's successful 2015 Level D (Associate Professor) promotion application at ANU, following an unsuccessful 2014 attempt. The 2015 application demonstrates exceptional performance across all criteria: research impact evidenced by h-index of 9 (equal 6th among all Level D Go8 pure mathematicians since 1996, equal 5th since 2008) and 2015 Christopher Heyde Medal; teaching excellence through voluntary MATH3325 honours teaching during DECRA fellowship with strong course evaluations (4.3-4.4/5) and year-over-year improvement; and extensive service as MathOverflow co-founder/moderator (4,438 reputation, appointed 2013), HDR convenor, AustMS Council member, and arXiv advisory committee member. The application package includes official proforma documents, one-page summary, comprehensive research/teaching/service statements (LaTeX source and PDFs), meticulously compiled supporting documentation package (citation comparisons, course evaluations, medal announcement, MathOverflow evidence), interview notes, and academic promotions policy guidance. The prior 2014 application materials provide context for the evolution of the application strategy, showing the successful refinement of the case for early promotion based on 24 papers, extensive grant funding (DECRA, Discovery, DARPA), and international recognition.
