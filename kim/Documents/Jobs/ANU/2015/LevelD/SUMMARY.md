# LevelD

## Overview

Level D (Associate Professor) promotion application materials from 2015, including complete application package with proforma documents, one-page summary, comprehensive research/teaching/service statements (LaTeX source and PDFs), supporting documentation (h-index comparisons, course evaluations, Heyde Medal, MathOverflow evidence), interview notes, academic promotions policy guidance, and prior 2014 application materials. The application emphasizes Scott Morrison's exceptional research output (24 papers, h-index of 9, recent Christopher Heyde Medal), successful grant record (DECRA, Discovery, DARPA), extensive service (MathOverflow co-founder/moderator, HDR convenor, AustMS Council, arXiv advisory board), and teaching excellence (voluntary MATH3325 teaching during DECRA, MATH1014 coordination).
