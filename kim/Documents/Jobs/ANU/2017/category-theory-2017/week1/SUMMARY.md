# week1

## Overview

First week materials from the category theory reading course, featuring An Ran Chen's presentation on foundational category theory concepts. The session covered basic definitions (categories, functors, natural transformations) with concrete examples from group theory and ring theory. Nine students attended. Course discussion explored deep questions about the limitations of categorical thinking and whether certain functors (like center-of-group) can exist.

| AnRan-presentation.pdf | Two-page meeting summary documenting topics covered (definitions of category, functor, natural transformation with examples like forgetful functors and abelianization), discussion questions (existence of natural transformations, center functor problem), and An Ran's self-reflection on presentation style |
| monoids.md | Scott Morrison's course notes exploring whether monoids can be equivalent (or isomorphic) to their opposites, providing lemmas characterizing functors/natural transformations between monoids, and presenting counterexamples using endomorphism monoids and custom three-element monoids |
