## Overview

Week 5 materials for Kie Seng Nge's presentation on representable functors, delivered March 22, 2017. The session covered the Hom functor H^A, representability conditions, and Proposition 4.1.11 connecting adjunctions to representable functors. Seven students attended and discussed examples including forgetful functors from Set and Grp, with detailed examination of naturality squares. The presenter ran out of time before introducing Yoneda's lemma. The report includes feedback on presentation style and self-reflection on organization.
