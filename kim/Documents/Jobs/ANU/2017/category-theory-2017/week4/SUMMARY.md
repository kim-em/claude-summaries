## Overview

Week 4 materials from James Bailie's presentation on March 16, 2017, covering comma categories, slice categories, and their relationship to adjunctions. The presentation focused on showing how slice categories are special cases of comma categories, and how adjunctions correspond to initial objects in comma categories. Nine students attended (Joanne, Kie Seng, Yao, An Ran, James, Jane, Elke, Yahya, Zac). Since this folder contains no subdirectories, it is marked as complete.
