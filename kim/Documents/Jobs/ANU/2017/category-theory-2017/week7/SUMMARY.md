## Overview

Week 7 presentation materials from Xiang Li's session on April 19, 2017, covering applications of the Yoneda Lemma and isomorphism of representables. The presentation proved that the Yoneda embedding is full and faithful, explored properties of full and faithful functors, and demonstrated a key corollary relating isomorphism of hom-functors to isomorphism of objects. Attended by six students (Jane, Joanne, James, Kie Seng, An Ran, Xiang). The presenter arrived late and couldn't complete all examples, with self-reflective notes on improving whiteboard presentation structure.
