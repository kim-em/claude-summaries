# week2

## Overview

Week 2 session materials from March 2, 2017, featuring Zachary Dowton's presentation on functors and categorical equivalence. The presentation covered faithful/full functors, subcategories, essentially surjective functors, equivalence of categories, and initial/terminal objects. The session included active discussion about the distinction between injective and faithful functors, whether functor images form subcategories, and collaborative example construction. Attendance included 10 students (Jane, An Ran, James, Yahya, Nge Kie Seng, Joanna, Likun Yao, Yao Fan, Jianing Zhao, and Zac).
