# week6

## Overview

Joanne Zheng's week 6 presentation materials covering Yoneda's lemma and related concepts from Leinster's textbook (sections 4.1.16 through 4.2.1). The presentation covered representability, Yoneda embedding, and generalized elements, with discussion focusing on the distinction between covariant and contravariant Hom functors and the rationale for generalized element terminology. Attendance included 6 students (Joanne, Kie Seng, An Ran, James, Yao, Jane).
