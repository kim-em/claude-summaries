# category-theory-2017

## Overview

MATH3349 Category Theory reading course from 2017 with 11 enrolled students, structured around Tom Leinster's "Basic Category Theory" textbook. The course followed a progressive arc through foundational category theory: basic definitions (categories, functors, natural transformations), categorical equivalence and adjunctions, representable functors, and culminating in Yoneda's lemma and embedding. Seven documented weekly sessions featured student presentations with active discussion, covering An Ran Chen on foundational concepts (week 1), Zachary Dowton on functors and equivalence (week 2), Yahya Fidouh on adjunctions (week 3), James Bailie on comma categories (week 4), Kie Seng Nge on representables (week 5), Joanne Zheng on Yoneda's lemma (week 6), and Xiang Li on Yoneda embedding applications (week 7). Each session included detailed presentation reports with peer feedback and self-reflections. Assessment consisted of assignments (40%), final essays (35%), presentation reports (10%), and final presentations (15%). Course materials include problem sets, LaTeX sources, reference excerpts, and Scott Morrison's supplementary notes on monoid equivalences and categorical concepts. Attendance ranged from 6-10 students per session, with consistent core participation.
