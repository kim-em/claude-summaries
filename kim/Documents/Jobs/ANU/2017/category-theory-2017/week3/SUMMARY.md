# week3

## Overview

Week 3 session materials from March 9, 2017, featuring Yahya Fidouh's presentation on adjoint functors. The session covered the two definitions of adjoint functors (via Hom sets and via units/counits), examples including free/forgetful functors between categories like Vect_k, Grp, Mon, and Set, composition of adjoints, triangle identities, and related theorems. Discussion centered on understanding the definition of adjoint functors and the relationship to equivalence of categories. Attendance: 8 students (Yahya, An Ran, Zak, Xiang, James, Yao, Joanne, Kie Sang).
