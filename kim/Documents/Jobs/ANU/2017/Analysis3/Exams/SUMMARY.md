## Overview

Final examination materials for MATH3325/MATH6214 Advanced Functional Analysis course, Semester 2 2017. Contains the actual final exam with 6 questions covering Fourier transforms, reflexive Banach spaces, spectral theory, bilateral shift operators, Radon integration, and spectral approximation. Also includes a larger set of rejected exam problems (14 questions total) that were considered but not used on the final. Includes graded student exams from all 14 enrolled students and a collection of past exams from 2013-2017 for reference. Uses the MSI exam class file for standardized formatting.
