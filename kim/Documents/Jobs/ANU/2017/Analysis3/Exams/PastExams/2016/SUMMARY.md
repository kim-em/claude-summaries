## Overview

2016 Semester 2 final examination materials for MATH3325/MATH6214 Advanced Functional Analysis, Spectral Theory, and Applications at ANU. Contains the complete exam (5 questions worth 50 points total), handwritten solutions (17 pages), and a collection of 7 rejected practice problems. The exam covers spectral theory of the unilateral shift operator, decomposition of bounded operators into positive operators, Fourier multiplier operators and their properties, weak-* density of atomic measures, and properties of separable Banach spaces including isometric embeddings and quotient completeness. Problems are adapted from Stein & Shakarchi volumes III and IV.
