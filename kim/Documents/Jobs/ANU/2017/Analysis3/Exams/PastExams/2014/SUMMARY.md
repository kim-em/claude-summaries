# 2014

## Overview

The 2014 final examination materials for MATH3325/MATH6214 (Analysis 3 Honours - Functional Analysis, Spectral Theory and Applications) at ANU. This folder contains the actual 3-hour exam paper (10 problems, 135 points), a comprehensive pool of candidate/possible exam problems (substantially longer than the actual exam), a file with one candidate question about measure continuity, and rejected problems covering topics like Holder's inequality, Lp space inclusions, spectra, Banach algebras, and reflexivity. The exam covers measure theory, Banach/Hilbert spaces, spectral theory of compact operators, functional calculus, Stone-Weierstrass theorem, and quotient spaces.
