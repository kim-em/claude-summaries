## Overview

2013 final examination materials for MATH3325/MATH6214 Analysis 3 Honours (Functional Analysis, Spectral Theory and Applications). Contains the exam paper with 6 problems worth 100 points total, covering Lp spaces, spectrum of the unilateral shift, self-adjoint operators, compact operators, the Volterra operator norm, and weak sequential compactness in Banach spaces. Includes sample solutions (large PDF with worked answers) and rejected exam problems covering topics like expressing operators as linear combinations of unitaries, Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures, reflexivity of Banach spaces, and the parallelogram law characterization of Hilbert spaces.
