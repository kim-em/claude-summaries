# 2017

## Overview

Copy of the 2017 final examination for MATH3325/MATH6214 Advanced Functional Analysis, Spectral Theory, and Applications at ANU. Contains the exam paper (6 questions, 60 points total), comprehensive handwritten solutions (11 pages), and rejected exam problems (16 pages with 15 candidate questions). The exam covered Fourier transforms (spectrum computation), reflexive Banach spaces, norm convergence of self-adjoint operators with functional calculus, bilateral shift operators, Radon integrals with Fubini's theorem, and approximation by diagonalizable operators.
