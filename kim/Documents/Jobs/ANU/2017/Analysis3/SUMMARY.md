# Analysis3

## Overview

Complete course materials for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course taught in Semester 2, 2017 at ANU (14 students). This advanced mathematics course covers Hilbert spaces, compact operators, spectral theory, measure theory, integration theory, the Fourier transform, Banach spaces, and applications to partial differential equations. The course uses Stein and Shakarchi's "Real Analysis" (Vol. III) and "Functional Analysis" (Vol. IV) as primary texts, supplemented by extensive custom lecture notes. Assessment includes weekly problem sets, four assignments with sample solutions, essay topics covering advanced topics (wavelets, trace class operators, C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras), and a final exam. Includes an Education Access Plan for a student with accommodations.
