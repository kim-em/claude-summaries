# Analysis3

## Overview

Complete course archive for MATH3325/MATH6214 Advanced Functional Analysis Honours course taught in Semester 2, 2017 at ANU (14 students total: 10 undergrads, 6 postgrads including research students). This rigorous course develops a coherent mathematical path from Hilbert space theory through spectral theory to Banach spaces, with parallel coverage of measure theory and integration. The course is structured around Stein and Shakarchi's Princeton Lectures in Analysis series (volumes III and IV on Real Analysis and Functional Analysis), supplemented by 14 custom lecture notes plus 3 appendices written by the instructor. Topics include orthonormal bases, Riesz representation theorem, adjoints, compact operators, Calkin algebra, Fourier transform, fundamental solutions for PDEs, Dirichlet problem, measure theory, Lebesgue integration, Radon-Nikodym derivatives, Stone-Weierstrass theorem, spectral theory, and Banach space theory (dual spaces, Hahn-Banach, Baire category).

Assessment comprises weekly problem sets (4 sets with detailed hints), four written assignments worth 100 marks each (80 for content, 20 for writing quality), an essay component on advanced topics (wavelets, Hilbert transform, C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras, ergodic theory, Brownian motion, FFT), and a 3-hour final exam with 6 questions covering Fourier transforms, reflexive Banach spaces, spectral theory, bilateral shift operators, and Radon integration. Grade records show final scores ranging from 87.63 to 43.07, with Mathematica-based grade scaling using logistic sigmoid transformations. The archive preserves complete student work including 60 assignment submissions, 27 essay submissions (drafts and finals), and 14 graded final exams, along with all course materials, solutions, and reference textbooks. Also includes Education Access Plan documentation for student accommodations and SELT survey request forms.
