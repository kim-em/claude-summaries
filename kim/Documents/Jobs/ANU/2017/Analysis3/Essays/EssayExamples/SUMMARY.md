## Overview

Collection of four exemplar essays from previous years (2009-2013) provided to Analysis 3 Honours students as models for the essay component. Topics span advanced functional analysis including trace class operators and Lidskii's theorem (Phelan 2009), representation theory and the Peter-Weyl theorem (Lim 2013), Bochner's theorem on Fourier-Stieltjes transforms (Lei 2013), and fixed point theorems including Markov-Kakutani and Kakutani's theorem (Keese). Essays demonstrate expected depth, rigor, and expository style for the MATH3325 essay requirement.
