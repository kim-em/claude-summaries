# ProblemSets

## Overview

Weekly problem sets for the MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course, consisting of 4 problem sets with LaTeX source files, compiled PDFs, and detailed hints documents. These problem sets were designed to be discussed in weekly tutorials and cover topics in Hilbert spaces, $L^p$ spaces, bounded linear transformations (BLTs), orthogonal projections, finite rank operators, and compact operators. The folder also contains a collection of past problem sets from previous course offerings.
