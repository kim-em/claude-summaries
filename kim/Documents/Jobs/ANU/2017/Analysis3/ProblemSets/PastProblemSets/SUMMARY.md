# PastProblemSets

## Overview

Archive of problem sets from previous offerings of MATH3325 Analysis 3, spanning 2010 and 2012. These LaTeX source files contain problem sets focusing on measure theory, weak topology, Hilbert space theory, and functional analysis topics. The collection serves as a reference for course evolution and provides additional practice problems covering measure spaces, absolute continuity, Hausdorff dimension, weak convergence, and the Radon-Nikodym theorem.
