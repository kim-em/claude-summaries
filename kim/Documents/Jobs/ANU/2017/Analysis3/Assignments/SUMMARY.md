# Assignments

## Overview

Four assignments for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2017) covering functional analysis and measure theory topics. Each assignment is worth 100 marks (80 for content, 20 for writing quality). Topics progress from Hilbert spaces and compact operators (Assignment 1), through Fourier transforms and wave equations (Assignment 2), measure theory and product spaces (Assignment 3), to spectral theory and Banach spaces (Assignment 4). Includes LaTeX source files, compiled PDFs, sample solutions (released and unreleased), and student submission folders organized by assignment.
