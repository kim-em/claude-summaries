# Assignment4Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for Assignment 4 of MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours (Semester 2, 2017). Contains 13 PDF submissions covering spectral properties, the closed graph theorem, weak topology on l^p spaces, and reflexive Banach spaces. Unlike earlier assignment folders, this one has no "graded" subfolder - marking may have been handled differently or these are archived originals.
