## Overview

Graded versions of MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours Assignment 3 submissions with instructor annotations. Contains 14 PDFs with handwritten red-ink feedback including per-problem scores, checkmarks, corrections, and pedagogical comments. Annotations include both specific mathematical corrections (e.g., measurability arguments, notation suggestions) and positive feedback ("Very well written!", "Very nice!"). File sizes are larger than originals due to annotation layers (460KB-9.7MB). Notably includes u5829965's graded submission which has no corresponding original in the parent folder, suggesting a late submission added directly to grading.
