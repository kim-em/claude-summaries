# Assignment3Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours Assignment 3, covering measure theory topics including distribution functions, Fubini/Tonelli theorem failure cases, Fatou's lemma, and convergence in measure vs L^1 convergence. Contains 14 original student PDF submissions (ranging from 116KB to 8MB) and a graded subfolder with annotated versions. Most submissions are identified by student name; two are identified only by student ID (u5798374, u5806726). One graded submission (u5829965) exists without a corresponding original, likely a late submission added directly to grading. Notably, u5806726's submission is exceptionally large (8MB original, 9.5MB graded), possibly containing scanned handwritten work.
