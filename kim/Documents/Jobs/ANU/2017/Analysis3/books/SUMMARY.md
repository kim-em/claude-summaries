## Overview

Reference textbook collection for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Honours course. Contains the complete Stein & Shakarchi Princeton Lectures in Analysis series (all 4 volumes plus solutions manual for volume 3), which served as the primary textbook, along with supplementary texts on functional analysis (Conway, Bressan, Pedersen), Hilbert spaces (Halmos), and spectral theory (Helmberg). These textbooks cover topics including Fourier analysis, complex analysis, real analysis, functional analysis, Hilbert spaces, compact operators, spectral theory, measure theory, and integration theory.
