# Adele-Jackson-UQ-ASC

## Overview

Materials for Adele Jackson's AMSI-funded Australian Summer Course (ASC) research project completed at University of Queensland under supervisor Dr Benjamin Burton (UQ) with ANU co-marker Scott Morrison, during summer 2016-2017. The project investigated fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) of the unknot recognition problem in computational topology, specifically exploring whether unknot recognition is FPT in the cutwidth of the dual graph of a triangulation of the knot complement manifold. Adele received a final mark of 92% (High Distinction) for her comprehensive 12-page report and blackboard presentation.
