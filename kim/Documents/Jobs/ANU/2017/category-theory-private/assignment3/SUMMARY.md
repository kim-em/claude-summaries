# assignment3

## Overview

Student submissions for MATH3349 Category Theory Assignment 3 from May 2017, containing handwritten and typed solutions from four students working on advanced category theory problems including monoidal categories, strictness theorems, module objects, and representation theory. The assignment covers theoretical proofs about monoidal equivalences, tensor products, and the relationship between group representations and category theory.
