# 2017

## Overview

Sixth year of ANU faculty employment documenting a major career milestone with the award of ARC Future Fellowship FT17 (Topological phases of matter), extensive teaching across four courses (MATH3349 Category Theory with 11 students, MATH3349 Representation Theory with Zsuzsi Dancso with 9 students, MATH1014 with Joan Licata with 355 students, MATH3325 Analysis 3 with 14 students), continuing HDR Convenor role, and significant research output including three preprints and two publications on extended Haagerup subfactor and enriched monoidal categories. Notable student supervision included two PhD students (Cain Edie-Michell nearing completion, Dominic Weiller starting), three honours students (Yanbai Zhang, Angus Gruen who received University Medal, Sam Quinn co-supervised with Tony Licata), vacation scholars, and summer ASC students. PDR self-assessment notes growing interest in interactive theorem proving as a new research direction.
