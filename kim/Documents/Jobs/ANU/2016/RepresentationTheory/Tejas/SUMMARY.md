# Tejas

## Overview

Tejas Iyer's course materials from the Representation Theory of Finite Groups special topics course (Semester 1, 2016). Contains a comprehensive 14-page draft final report on computing characters of finite groups, along with three problem sets covering fundamental topics in representation theory including irreducible representations, characters, central characters, and applications to specific groups like the Mathieu group M11.
