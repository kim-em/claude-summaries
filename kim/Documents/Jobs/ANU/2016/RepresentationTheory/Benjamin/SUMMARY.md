Course materials and final report by Benjamin Thompson for a special topics Representation Theory course (Semester 1 2016). Contains drafts and final version of a report on the Burnside-Dixon Algorithm for computing character tables of finite groups, plus supplementary materials on Hurwitz's Theorem and normal subgroups of D8.
