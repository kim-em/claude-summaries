# RepresentationTheory

## Overview

Special topics course on Representation Theory of Finite Groups taught in Semester 1 2016 with two students: Benjamin Thompson and Tejas Iyer. The course focused on computational approaches to character theory, particularly the Burnside-Dixon-Schneider algorithm for computing character tables of finite groups. Student work includes comprehensive final reports demonstrating mastery of theoretical foundations (irreducible representations, central characters, orthogonality relations, Frobenius-Schur indicators) and computational applications (computing characters of specific groups like the Mathieu group M11). Benjamin's work explores the historical development from Burnside's 1911 method through Dixon's 1967 improvement, plus supplementary topics on Hurwitz algebras and composition algebras. Tejas's materials include both a substantial final report and three problem sets covering the progression from basic representation theory through advanced computational techniques. Both students demonstrated ability to work with modern computational tools (GAP software) and connect abstract theory to concrete examples.
