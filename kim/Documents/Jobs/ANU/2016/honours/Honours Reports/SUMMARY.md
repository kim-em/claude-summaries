# Honours Reports

## Overview

Central repository of grading documentation for the 2016 ANU Mathematics honours cohort. Contains supervisor reports (SR) and reader reports (RR) for 10 honours students: Chalker, Crilly, Harris, Hunter, Iyer, Jeffs, McCarthy, Rowlands, Thompson, and Wang. Also includes reports for Zhihao Qiao (Jake), an honours student whose thesis on the chemical master equation with low rank tensor approximations received mixed reviews suggesting 2A-level work. The folder includes a marks spreadsheet and two subdirectories: one with all honours theses as PDFs, and another with Masters student reports (Elliot Herrington, Johnny Lim, and Huicheng Liang on numerical algorithms for image denoising).
