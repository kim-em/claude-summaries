# Masters

## Overview

Grading documentation for three ANU Masters students from 2016, all supervised through the Mathematical Sciences Institute. Contains supervisor and examiner reports for Elliot Herrington (invariant metrics in complex analysis, first-class at 86), Johnny Lim (Maslov index and spectral flow, first-class at 86), and Huicheng Liang (image denoising algorithms, recommended 75). All three theses covered advanced mathematical material beyond standard coursework.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Elliot Herrington examiners' report.pdf | Examiners report by Brett Parker and Alan Carey on Herrington's thesis on Caratheodory and Kobayashi-Royden invariant metrics in complex analysis; recommends mark of 86 |
| Elliot Herrington supervisor's report.pdf | Supervisor report by Alexander Isaev noting Herrington's significant progress despite initially weak background in complex analysis; lists specific technical issues but recommends mid-80s |
| Johnny Lim.pdf | Examiners report by Brett Parker and John Urbas on Lim's thesis relating Maslov index to spectral flow in Lagrangian Floer theory; recommends mark of 86 |
| JohnnyLimThesisReport.pdf | Supervisor report by Bryan Wang praising Lim's independent study and successful proof of Floer's SF=Maslov identity despite limited undergraduate preparation; recommends mark around 86 |
| Supervisor's report on Huicheng Liang.pdf | Supervisor report by Qinian Jin on Liang's thesis on Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm and ADMM for image denoising; notes good progress from weak math background but suggests mark of 75 |
| report_HLiang.txt | Reader report by Stephen Roberts and Markus Hegland on Liang's thesis; criticizes careless formulation and unclear mathematical modeling but acknowledges reasonable understanding; recommends grade of 75 |
