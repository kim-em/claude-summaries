# Maynard

## Overview

Honours thesis materials for Lachlan Maynard from ANU 2016, supervised by Joan Licata. The thesis "The Combinatorial Knot Floer Homology of a Knot in a Lens Space" studies Heegaard-Floer link homology for knots in lens spaces, attempting to provide a purely combinatorial proof of invariance for the chain complex. The work extends results from S^3 to lens spaces L(p,q) using twisted toroidal grid diagrams. The grader's report by Anthony Licata and Scott Morrison notes that while commutation invariance is proven, stabilization invariance remains incomplete; they suggest a mark of 78.
