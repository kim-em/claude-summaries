## Overview

Honours student supervision and grading materials from 2016 at ANU, documenting a cohort of students working on topics in low-dimensional topology, combinatorics, and formal verification. The folder contains detailed records for individual supervised students: Benjamin Thompson (Khovanov homology of rational tangles, first-class thesis rated 90-93), Tejas Iyer (asymptotic enumeration of random tournaments by score sequence, with three examiner reports praising publishable original research), Lachlan Maynard (combinatorial knot Floer homology in lens spaces, graded 78 with incomplete stabilization invariance proof), Florence Verity (formal verification of vote counting with Coq), and Victor Wang (cluster algebras and Grassmannians). The central "Honours Reports" folder aggregates grading documentation for the entire 2016 MSI honours cohort (10 students: Chalker, Crilly, Harris, Hunter, Iyer, Jeffs, McCarthy, Rowlands, Thompson, Wang), plus supervision records for three Masters students (Herrington, Lim, Liang) and a comprehensive thesis archive.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Victor Wang - report.txt | Supervisor's thesis report for Victor Wang on cluster algebras - notes thesis covers Grassmannians, cluster algebra theory, and double Bruhat cells; suggests grade around 85 |
