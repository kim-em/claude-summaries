# Iyer

## Overview

Examiner reports for Tejas Iyer's 2016 ANU honours thesis on random tournaments. The thesis investigated asymptotic enumeration of tournaments by score sequence using methods developed by Isaev and McKay. All three examiners praised the work highly, noting it contained publishable original research (40+ pages of novel material) and demonstrated strong research potential. The supervisor (McKay) indicated the main theorem would be submitted for publication as a three-author paper.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| McKay-report.pdf | Supervisor's report by Brendan McKay - describes the two-part project (literature survey + original asymptotic estimates), notes Tejas found errors in the supervisors' own paper, rates research potential very highly, would welcome as PhD student |
| Portal-report.pdf | Examiner report by Pierre Portal - praises clarity, depth of understanding, and 40+ pages of original results; notes thesis demonstrates readiness for PhD or R&D work (e.g., Google, ASD) |
| Trudgian-report.pdf | Assessor report by Tim Trudgian - notes numerous typos and bibliography errors but commends mathematical correctness and clear exposition; identifies possible minor errors in Corollary 5.6.3; concludes thesis shows strong research potential |
