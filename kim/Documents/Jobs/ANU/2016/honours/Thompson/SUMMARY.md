# Thompson

## Overview

Supervisor report for Benjamin Thompson's 2016 ANU honours thesis on Khovanov homology of rational tangles. The thesis presents a new result giving an efficient and unexpectedly simple description of the Khovanov homology invariant for rational tangles. Ben studied Dror Bar-Natan's tangle invariant definition and developed an algorithm to write down minimal representatives using the recursive structure of rational tangles (via continued fractions). Rated first class but not medal-worthy; readers suggested 90-93 range, supervisor thought slightly high.
