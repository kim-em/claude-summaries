# Notes

## Overview

Container directory for MATH1014 course notes. Contains comprehensive LaTeX-based lecture notes for the linear algebra component of the course, taught by A/Prof Scott Morrison. The linear algebra content comprises 25 lectures forming a complete undergraduate linear algebra sequence, progressing from geometric vectors through abstract vector spaces, eigenvalue theory, and orthogonality, to applications including Markov chains and PageRank. Each lecture includes multiple output formats (slides, handouts, annotated PDFs) generated from LaTeX sources through a sophisticated build system. The course materials reflect the significant linear algebra component of MATH1014 alongside the calculus content taught by Griffith Ware.
