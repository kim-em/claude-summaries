# diagrams

## Overview

Collection of vector diagrams illustrating geometric concepts for Lecture 4 on distances in R³. Includes 3D coordinate system diagrams showing distances between points, lines, and planes, using vector notation. Most diagrams are available in multiple formats (PDF, DOC source files). The diagrams illustrate key concepts including point-to-plane distance, point-to-line distance, and distance between parallel and skew lines.
