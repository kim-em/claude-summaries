# diagrams

## Overview

Supporting diagrams for Lecture 22 on the Gram-Schmidt process and QR factorization. Includes 3D geometric visualization of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm and a sequence of diagrams illustrating least squares solutions through orthogonal projection onto column spaces.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GramSchm.png` | 3D diagram showing Gram-Schmidt process: plane Span{x₁,x₂} with vectors v₁=x₁, v₂ (orthogonal component of x₂), and coordinate axes |
| `leastsq0.png` | Least squares setup: vector b outside Col A, showing Ax and Ay vectors in the column space plane |
| `leastsq1.png` | Least squares solution: orthogonal projection b̂=Ax̂ of vector b onto Col A, with perpendicular shown |
| `leastsq2.png` | Least squares residual: showing error vector b-Ax̂ perpendicular to Col A |
| `ex1.pdf` | Additional example diagram (PDF format, likely generated from LaTeX) |
