# Lecture08

## Overview

Lecture 8 materials covering coordinate systems and change of basis in linear algebra. The lecture explores how to convert between different coordinate systems using change of coordinate matrices, presents two approaches for computing these matrices, and works through detailed examples including polynomial spaces and matrix spaces. Topics include the Unique Representation Theorem, isomorphisms between vector spaces, and the dimension theorem. The lecture includes three carefully designed diagrams that visualize the geometric interpretation of coordinate mappings and illustrate how the same vector appears differently when expressed in different coordinate systems (standard basis vs. alternative basis B).
