# Lecture23

## Overview

Lecture 23 introduces the Least Squares Problem, which finds the best approximation to a solution of an inconsistent system of linear equations Ax = b. The lecture derives the normal equations (A^T A x̂ = A^T b), proves their equivalence to least squares solutions, and presents multiple worked examples. An optional section on QR factorization methods for solving least squares problems is included but was not covered in class.
