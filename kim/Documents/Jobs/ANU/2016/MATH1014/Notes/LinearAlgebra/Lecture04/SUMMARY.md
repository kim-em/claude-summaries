# Lecture04

## Overview

Lecture materials for Lecture 4 on distances in R³, focusing on computing distances between geometric objects (points, lines, planes) in three-dimensional space using vector methods. The lecture systematically develops distance formulas using dot products, cross products, and scalar projections, covering point-to-plane distance, point-to-line distance, and distance between two lines (both parallel and skew cases). Includes comprehensive visual support through a diagrams directory containing 25 illustrations in multiple formats (PDF, EPS, PNG, OmniGraffle, Word) that demonstrate the geometric concepts with labeled 3D coordinate systems and worked examples. The lecture is available in multiple formats: slides for presentation, 3-up handouts for students, scribbled annotations from actual lectures, and extended examples with additional exercises.
