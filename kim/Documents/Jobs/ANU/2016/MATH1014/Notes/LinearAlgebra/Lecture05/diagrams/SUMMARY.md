## Overview

Supporting visual diagrams for Lecture 5 on vector spaces and subspaces. Contains 3D coordinate system illustrations (plane H with axes x1, x2, x3), 2D vector diagrams showing vectors and their negatives (u and -u), and 2D coordinate plane examples. The diagrams illustrate geometric concepts related to subspaces, planes, and vector operations in both R² and R³.
