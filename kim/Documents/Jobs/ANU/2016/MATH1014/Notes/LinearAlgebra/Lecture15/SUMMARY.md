# Lecture15

## Overview

Lecture materials for the 15th lecture in the linear algebra component of MATH1014, focusing on the Diagonalization Theorem and its applications. The lecture provides detailed worked examples of diagonalizing matrices, including cases where diagonalization is possible (with distinct eigenvalues or when eigenspace dimensions match multiplicities) and cases where it fails (when eigenspace dimension is less than eigenvalue multiplicity). Includes theoretical results on the relationship between eigenspaces, multiplicities, and diagonalizability.
