## Overview

Visual diagrams supporting Lecture 8 on coordinate systems and change of basis. The folder contains three PDF figures illustrating key concepts: the geometric interpretation of coordinate mappings from vector spaces to ℝⁿ, and side-by-side comparisons of how the same vector appears on standard graph paper versus B-graph paper (where the basis B differs from the standard basis).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ex0801.pdf` | Figure 5 showing the coordinate mapping from vector space V onto ℝⁿ, with a vector x in V mapped to its coordinate representation [x]_B |
| `la0800.pdf` | Comparison diagram showing a vector x on standard graph paper (with basis e₁, e₂) versus B-graph paper (with basis b₁, b₂), illustrating how coordinates change with different bases |
| `la0801.pdf` | Special case diagram where b₁ = e₁, showing how the same vector appears when only one basis vector differs between standard and B-coordinate systems |
