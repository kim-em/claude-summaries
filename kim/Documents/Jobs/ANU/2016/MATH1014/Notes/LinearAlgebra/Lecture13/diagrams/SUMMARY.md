# diagrams

## Overview

Supporting diagrams and computational files for Lecture 13 on Markov chains and applications to linear algebra. Contains PDF diagrams illustrating Markov chain concepts (weather in the Land of Oz, rat maze experiment), Maple worksheet files (.mw) for matrix computations demonstrating state transitions, and an OmniGraffle source file for diagram creation.
