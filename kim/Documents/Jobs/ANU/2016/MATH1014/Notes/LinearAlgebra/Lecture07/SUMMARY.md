# Lecture07

## Overview

LaTeX source and generated PDFs for Lecture 7 of the Linear Algebra component, covering linear independence, bases, and coordinate systems for abstract vector spaces. The lecture introduces formal definitions of linear independence and linear dependence, provides the spanning set theorem, and develops methods for finding bases of null spaces and column spaces of matrices. Includes the unique representation theorem showing that coordinates relative to a basis are unique.
