## Overview

Diagram assets for Lecture 2 on dot products and cross products. Contains vector geometry diagrams illustrating key concepts including angles between vectors, vector projections, vector decomposition, 3D coordinate systems, and the right-hand rule for cross products. Includes both PDF exports and one OmniGraffle source file. The diagrams support teaching materials about dot products (computing angles, projections) and cross products (right-hand rule, geometric interpretation).
