## Overview

Visual assets supporting Lecture 18's discrete dynamical systems content. Contains trajectory diagrams illustrating fundamental dynamical system behaviors (attractors, repellors, saddle points, spirals) along with biological images for predator-prey ecological examples. The mathematical diagrams show phase plane trajectories with eigenvector directions, demonstrating how different eigenvalue configurations produce distinct long-term behaviors. Both PDF and PostScript versions are included for some diagrams, along with photographs of the species used in the lecture's ecological modeling examples.
