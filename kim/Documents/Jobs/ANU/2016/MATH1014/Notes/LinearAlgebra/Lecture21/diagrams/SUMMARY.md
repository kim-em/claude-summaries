## Overview

Geometric diagrams illustrating orthogonal projection concepts for Lecture 21. These PDF figures visualize the decomposition of vectors into components parallel and orthogonal to subspaces, the computation of projections using orthonormal bases, and the Best Approximation Theorem showing that the projection is the closest point in the subspace.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ex1.pdf` | 2D diagram showing projection of vector y onto a line spanned by unit vector u, with formula for the projection component |
| `ex2.pdf` | 3D diagram showing orthogonal decomposition of vector y into ŷ (projection onto subspace W spanned by orthonormal vectors u₁, u₂) and z (orthogonal component in W⊥) |
| `ex3.pdf` | 3D diagram illustrating projection of y onto shaded subspace W, showing ŷ = proj_W(y) as the orthogonal projection |
| `la2201.pdf` | 3D diagram demonstrating the Best Approximation Theorem: ŷ is the closest point in W to y, with distances ‖y - ŷ‖, ‖y - v‖, and ‖ŷ - v‖ for arbitrary v in W forming a right triangle |
