# Lecture25

## Overview

Final revision session for the linear algebra component of MATH1014, consisting of practice problems covering the entire semester's material. Contains both a problem sheet and complete worked solutions, along with a scribble PDF (likely in-class annotations). The 13 revision questions comprehensively review all major topics: change of basis, eigenvalues and diagonalization, complex eigenvalues, dynamical systems, Markov chains, orthogonal projections, Gram-Schmidt process, and linear transformations on abstract vector spaces.
