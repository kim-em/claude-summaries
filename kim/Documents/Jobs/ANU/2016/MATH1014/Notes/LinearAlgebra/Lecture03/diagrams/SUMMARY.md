## Overview

Diagram source files and compiled PDFs for Lecture 3's geometric illustrations. Contains OmniGraffle source files (.graffle) for 3D diagrams illustrating planes, lines, vectors, and their relationships in R³, along with corresponding PDFs for inclusion in the lecture materials. The diagrams visualize key concepts including normal vectors, direction vectors, position vectors, and the right-hand rule for cross products.
