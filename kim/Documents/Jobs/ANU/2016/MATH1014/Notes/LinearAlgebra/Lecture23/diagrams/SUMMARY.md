# diagrams

## Overview

This folder contains vector diagrams and a scatter plot illustrating the geometric interpretation of least squares solutions. The diagrams show orthogonal projection of vector b onto the column space of matrix A, demonstrating why the least squares solution x̂ minimizes ||b - Ax||. These figures support the theoretical presentation in Lecture 23.

| `bestfit.pdf` | Scatter plot showing data points with a best-fit line from least squares regression (coordinate grid from -1 to 4 on both axes) |
| `ex01.pdf` | 3D diagram showing orthogonal projection b̂ as the closest point in subspace W = Col A to vector b |
| `ex02.pdf` | 3D diagram illustrating the least squares solution Ax̂ in Col A with residual vector b - Ax̂ shown orthogonal to the subspace |
| `la2401.pdf` | Comprehensive 3D diagram showing the geometric relationship: Col A subspace, vector b above it, projection Ax̂, residual vector Ax perpendicular to Col A, and alternative solutions Ax and Aẋ |
| `leastsq0.png` | 3D diagram showing vector b, column space Col A (cyan plane), projection b̂=Ax̂ with right angle indicating orthogonality, and residual b-Ax̂ |
| `leastsq1.png` | 3D diagram emphasizing that projection b̂=Ax̂ lies in Col A with perpendicular from b to the subspace |
| `leastsq2.png` | 3D diagram showing the equivalence Ax̂=b̂ with residual b-Ax̂ orthogonal to Col A |
