# Lecture10

## Overview

Lecture 10 applies linear algebra to Markov chains, demonstrating how matrix algebra models probabilistic systems. The lecture covers stochastic matrices, probability vectors, transition matrices, steady-state vectors, and long-term behavior of regular Markov chains. Three detailed examples illustrate the concepts: bird population distribution in a zoo aviary, weather patterns in the fictional "Land of Oz", and rat movement in a three-compartment cage. Based on Lay §4.9, this material was noted as not examinable on the mid-semester exam. The lecture includes complete LaTeX source files and generated PDFs in multiple formats (slides, handouts), plus a large annotated PDF with handwritten notes from the actual lecture delivery.
