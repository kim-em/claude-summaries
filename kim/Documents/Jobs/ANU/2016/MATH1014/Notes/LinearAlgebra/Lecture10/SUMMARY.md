# Lecture10

## Overview

Lecture 10 covers applications of linear algebra to Markov chains, a probabilistic modeling tool using matrix algebra. Topics include stochastic matrices, probability vectors, transition matrices, steady-state vectors, and the long-term behavior of regular Markov chains. Includes three worked examples: bird population distribution in a zoo aviary, weather patterns in the fictional "Land of Oz", and rat movement in a three-compartment cage. This material is from Lay §4.9 and was noted as not examinable on the mid-semester exam.
