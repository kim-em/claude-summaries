# Lecture13

## Overview

Mid-semester examination review lecture covering problems from the 2013 exam. Topics include lines and planes in R³, bases and coordinate systems, vector spaces and subspaces, linear transformations, and null/column spaces of matrices. The lecture works through detailed solutions to sample questions covering all major topics from the first half of the course, followed by revision sections highlighting key definitions, theorems about bases, and geometric concepts.
