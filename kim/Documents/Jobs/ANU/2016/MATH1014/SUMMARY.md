# MATH1014

## Overview

Complete teaching archive for MATH1014 (Mathematics and Applications 1) Semester 2 2016, a large first-year course with approximately 400 students taught across 21 tutorial groups. The course combined calculus (taught by Griffith Ware) and linear algebra (taught by A/Prof Scott Morrison), with 11 tutors supporting the tutorials. This archive captures the full lifecycle of course delivery: extensive lecture notes (25 lectures on linear algebra topics from geometric vectors through eigenvalue theory and applications like PageRank), weekly tutorial worksheets for both components, graded assignments emphasizing mathematical writing, comprehensive examination materials with detailed administrative records for special consideration cases, three years of historical calculus worksheets (2013-2015) documenting curriculum evolution, SELT evaluation materials, and detailed grade tracking through multiple spreadsheet versions culminating in college-approved final grades. The collection demonstrates the substantial administrative complexity of managing a large first-year mathematics course with dual components, multiple assessment types, and careful accommodation of students requiring deferred exams or special consideration.
