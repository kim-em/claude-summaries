## Overview

Comprehensive examination materials for MATH1014 Semester 2 2016, encompassing both mid-semester and final exams for the course's dual linear algebra and calculus components. Contains complete exam lifecycle documentation: original exam papers with LaTeX sources, student information/study guide sheets, solutions, grade tracking spreadsheets, and statistical analysis via Mathematica notebooks. Substantial administrative records document the complexity of managing a large first-year course (~400 students), including special consideration cases and deferred exam arrangements for approximately 8-15 students across both exam periods. The deferred-midsemester-exams subdirectory preserves scanned submissions from six students who took alternative mid-semester exam arrangements, demonstrating the careful record-keeping required for students receiving accommodations.
