# Assignment

## Overview

Assignment materials for MATH1014 Semester 2 2016, consisting of a graded assignment due September 29 and a mock assignment for Week 6 tutorial practice. The graded assignment covers both linear algebra (Markov chain queue modeling) and calculus (power series convergence and differentiation), emphasizing mathematical writing skills. The mock assignment focuses on polynomial subspaces and linear transformations, designed for peer grading exercises in tutorial. All materials include complete solutions with detailed explanations and a marking rubric for grading consistency.
