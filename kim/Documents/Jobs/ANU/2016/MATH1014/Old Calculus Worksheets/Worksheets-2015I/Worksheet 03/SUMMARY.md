# Worksheet 03

## Overview

Week 3 calculus worksheet for MATH1014 covering first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and infinite series convergence. The worksheet contains two main problems: solving a separable ODE with an initial value problem, and evaluating an infinite series using partial fractions and telescoping sums. Materials include both student and solution versions as LaTeX source and compiled PDFs.
