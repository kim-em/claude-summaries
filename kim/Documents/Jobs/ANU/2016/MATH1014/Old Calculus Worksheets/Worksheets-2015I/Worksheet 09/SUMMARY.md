# Worksheet 09

## Overview

Week 9 calculus worksheet focusing on multivariable calculus topics, specifically partial differential equations and the multivariable chain rule. Contains two problems: verifying that the fundamental solution to Laplace's equation satisfies the PDE away from the origin, and applying the multivariable chain rule to find derivatives along parametric curves. Includes both the problem set and complete worked solutions.
