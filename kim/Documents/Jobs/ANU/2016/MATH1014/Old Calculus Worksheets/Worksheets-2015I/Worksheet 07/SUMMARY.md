# Worksheet 07

## Overview

Week 7 calculus tutorial worksheet from Semester 1 2015 for MATH1014. Contains two main problems: (1) Taylor polynomial approximation to estimate bounds for the constant e, using max/min of exponential functions and Lagrange remainder, and (2) parametric curve analysis including tangent lines, concavity, and curve sketching. Includes both current and old versions of LaTeX sources and compiled PDFs for both worksheet and answer key.
