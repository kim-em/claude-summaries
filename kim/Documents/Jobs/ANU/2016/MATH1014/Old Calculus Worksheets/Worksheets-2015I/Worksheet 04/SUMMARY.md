# Worksheet 04

## Overview

Week 4 calculus worksheet for MATH1014 covering differential equations with initial value problems, improper integrals with convergence tests, geometric applications of integration (arc length and volume of revolution), and series convergence/divergence tests. Contains LaTeX source files for both the problem sheet and the answer sheet with detailed solutions.
