# Worksheet 10

## Overview

Week 13 worksheet for MATH1014 Calculus covering multivariable calculus topics. The worksheet contains two main problems: (1) finding and classifying critical points using the Hessian matrix and second derivative test for a function of two variables, and (2) directional derivatives and gradient vector applications for finding maximum/minimum rates of change of a temperature function in three dimensions. Contains both problem sheet and detailed solutions with step-by-step working.
