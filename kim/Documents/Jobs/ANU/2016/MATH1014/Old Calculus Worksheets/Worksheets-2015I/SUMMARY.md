# Worksheets-2015I

## Overview

Complete set of 10 weekly calculus tutorial worksheets from Semester 1 2015 for MATH1014 at ANU. The collection follows a carefully structured curriculum progression: starting with single-variable integration techniques (Riemann sums, improper integrals, convergence tests, integration by parts) in Weeks 1-5, moving to geometric applications and series theory (solids of revolution, arc length, power series, Taylor polynomials) in Weeks 6-8, and culminating in multivariable calculus (partial differential equations, chain rule, critical points, directional derivatives) in Weeks 9-10. Each worksheet directory contains LaTeX source files for both problems and solutions, with compiled PDFs providing full worked solutions. The collection includes a master PDF (WA_MATH 1014_14II.pdf) combining all 10 worksheets with answers for convenient reference.
