# Worksheet 05

## Overview

Week 5 tutorial worksheet for MATH1014 Calculus (Semester 1 2015) covering power series convergence. Contains two problems: (1) finding the center, radius, and interval of convergence for a power series centered at x=-10, and (2) finding the MacLaurin series for an integral involving ln(t+1) and its radius of convergence. Includes both problem-only version and solutions version with detailed step-by-step answers applying ratio test, endpoint analysis, and series integration techniques.
