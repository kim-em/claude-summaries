# Worksheet 06

## Overview

Week 6 calculus worksheet focusing on parametric curves. Contains a single comprehensive problem on analyzing a parametric curve: finding slopes of tangent lines, identifying vertical and horizontal tangents, determining concavity, and sketching the curve. The folder includes LaTeX source files for both the problem sheet and answer sheet, their compiled PDFs, and a PDF image of the curve graph used in the solutions.
