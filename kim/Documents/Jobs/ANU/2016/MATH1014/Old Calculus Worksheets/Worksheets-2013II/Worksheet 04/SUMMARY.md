# Worksheet 04

## Overview

Week 4 calculus tutorial worksheet from August 26-30, 2013 for MATH1014 at ANU. Contains LaTeX source files for both the problem set and solutions version. Topics covered include initial value problems for differential equations, convergence of improper integrals using comparison tests, geometric applications of integration (arc length and volume of revolution), and series convergence using comparison and limit comparison tests.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
