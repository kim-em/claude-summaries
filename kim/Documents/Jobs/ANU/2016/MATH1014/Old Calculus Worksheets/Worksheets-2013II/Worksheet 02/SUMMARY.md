# Worksheet 02

## Overview

Week 2 calculus tutorial worksheet for MATH1014 from August 12-16, 2013. This worksheet focuses on applications of integration: calculating areas under curves and volumes of solids of revolution using the disk/washer method. The single problem involves a region bounded by y = 2/x², computing its area via definite integration, and finding the volume when rotated around a horizontal line below the x-axis.
