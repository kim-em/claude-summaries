# Worksheets-2013II

## Overview

Collection of 10 weekly calculus tutorial worksheets from Semester 2 2013 for MATH1014 (Calculus) at ANU. Each week contains LaTeX source files for both the problem set and the solutions (labeled with "WA" prefix for "with answers"). Topics covered include Riemann sums (midpoint approximations and error bounds), improper integrals, convergence/divergence tests using comparison tests and p-integrals, and integration by parts. Some weeks also include compiled PDF versions of the worksheets.
