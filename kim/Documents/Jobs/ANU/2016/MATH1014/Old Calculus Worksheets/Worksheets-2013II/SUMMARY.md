# Worksheets-2013II

## Overview

Complete archive of 10 weekly calculus tutorial worksheets from Semester 2 2013 (August-November) for MATH1014 at ANU. This collection follows a carefully structured curriculum progression: beginning with single-variable integration techniques (Riemann sums, improper integrals, areas and volumes of revolution), advancing through infinite series and power series convergence, then covering parametric curves and polar coordinates, and culminating in multivariable calculus topics (partial derivatives, PDEs, critical point analysis). Each worksheet includes LaTeX source files for both the problem set and complete worked solutions (labeled with "WA" prefix for "with answers"). Selected weeks include compiled PDFs with graphs and visualizations of the curves being analyzed.
