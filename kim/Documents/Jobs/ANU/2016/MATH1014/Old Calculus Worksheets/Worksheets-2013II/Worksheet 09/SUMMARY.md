# Worksheet 09

## Overview

Week 9 calculus worksheet for MATH1014 from October 21-25, 2013. Contains two advanced problems covering partial differential equations and multivariable calculus. The first problem involves proving that the fundamental solution to the Laplace equation satisfies the PDE ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² = 0. The second problem applies the chain rule to find df/dt for a function of two variables along a parametric ellipse. LaTeX source files are provided both with and without worked solutions.
