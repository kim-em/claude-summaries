# Worksheet 07

## Overview

Week 7 calculus tutorial worksheet from October 8-11, 2013 for MATH1014 at ANU. Focuses on parametric curves and polar coordinates. Contains two main problems: calculating the area under a parametric curve, and analyzing the polar rose curve r=cos(2θ) including finding horizontal/vertical tangent points and sketching the curve. This is a leaf folder with no subdirectories.
