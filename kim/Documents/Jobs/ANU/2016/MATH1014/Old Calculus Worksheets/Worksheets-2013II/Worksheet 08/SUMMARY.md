# Worksheet 08

## Overview

Week 8 calculus tutorial worksheet for MATH1014 from October 14-18, 2013. Contains two problems focused on polar coordinates: calculating the area enclosed by a cardioid curve (r=2+2cos(θ)) and finding the arc length of a circle expressed in polar form (r=2cos(θ)). The worksheet demonstrates applications of polar integration formulas for area and arc length calculations.
