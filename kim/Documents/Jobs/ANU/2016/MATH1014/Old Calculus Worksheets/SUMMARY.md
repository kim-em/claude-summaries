# Old Calculus Worksheets

## Overview

Comprehensive archive of three years of MATH1014 calculus tutorial worksheets (Semester 2 2013, Semester 2 2014, and Semester 1 2015) representing the evolution of the course's calculus curriculum. Each collection contains 10 weekly worksheets following a consistent pedagogical progression: foundational single-variable integration techniques and convergence tests (Weeks 1-5), geometric applications including parametric curves and polar coordinates (Weeks 6-8), and multivariable calculus culminating in critical point analysis and partial differential equations (Weeks 9-10). All three years follow nearly identical curricula with minor variations, making this archive valuable for understanding curriculum consistency and refinement over time. The 2014 and 2015 collections include compiled master PDFs (24 pages each) combining all worksheets for convenient reference. All materials are provided in LaTeX source format with complete worked solutions.
