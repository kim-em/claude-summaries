# Worksheet 04

## Overview

Weekly calculus tutorial worksheet for MATH1014 from August 26-29, 2014 (Week 4). Contains LaTeX sources for both the problem sheet and solution sheet. Topics include differential equations with initial values, improper integrals with comparison tests, geometric derivations of circle circumference and sphere volume using arc length and volumes of revolution, and series convergence tests. This worksheet bridges earlier topics (ODEs, improper integrals, series) with geometric applications of calculus.
