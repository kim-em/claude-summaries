# Worksheet 01

## Overview

LaTeX source files for the first week's calculus tutorial (August 05-08, 2014) covering foundational integration topics. Contains both the problem sheet and complete solution sheet covering Riemann sums, improper integrals, and convergence/divergence tests. Problems include midpoint approximations with error bounds, integration by parts for exponential/trigonometric functions, and comparison tests for improper integrals.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Worksheet 01_MATH 1014_14II.tex | Problem sheet with 3 exercises: midpoint Riemann sum for ∫x²dx, improper integrals (∫e⁻ˣsin(x)dx and ∫ln(x)dx), and convergence tests |
| WA 01_MATH 1014_14II.tex | Complete solution sheet with detailed worked solutions including error bound calculations, integration by parts steps, and comparison test justifications |
