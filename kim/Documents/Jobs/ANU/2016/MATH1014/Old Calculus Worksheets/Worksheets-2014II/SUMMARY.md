# Worksheets-2014II

## Overview

Weekly calculus tutorial worksheets from MATH1014 Semester 2 2014, spanning August to October. Contains 10 weekly worksheet folders plus a compiled PDF (WA_MATH 1014_14II.pdf, 900KB) combining all worksheets. Topics progress from Riemann sums and improper integrals (Week 1) through power series and MacLaurin series (Week 5) to multivariable calculus with critical points and Hessian matrices (Week 10). Each weekly folder contains LaTeX source files for both the problem sheet and solution sheet.
