# Worksheets-2014II

## Overview

Complete collection of 10 weekly calculus tutorial worksheets from MATH1014 Semester 2 2014 (August-October). The course follows a carefully structured progression: foundational integration techniques (Weeks 1-4) including Riemann sums, improper integrals, convergence tests, ODEs, and volumes of revolution; power series and MacLaurin series convergence (Week 5); parametric curves covering tangent lines, concavity, arclength, and area calculations (Weeks 6-7); polar coordinates (Week 8); and culminating in multivariable calculus with partial differential equations, chain rule, and critical point analysis using Hessian matrices (Weeks 9-10). Each weekly folder contains LaTeX source files for both problem sheets and complete solution sheets with detailed worked answers. A compiled PDF (WA_MATH 1014_14II.pdf, 921KB, 24 pages) combines all 10 worksheets for convenient reference.
