# Worksheet 06

## Overview

Tutorial worksheet for MATH 1014 Calculus, week 6 (September 30 - October 3, 2014). Focuses on parametric curves with a single comprehensive problem analyzing the curve defined by x=4t², y=t³-12t. Students find tangent line slopes, identify vertical/horizontal tangents, determine concavity, and sketch the curve. The problem sheet and answer sheet are provided as LaTeX sources, with a graph of the curve as PDF.
