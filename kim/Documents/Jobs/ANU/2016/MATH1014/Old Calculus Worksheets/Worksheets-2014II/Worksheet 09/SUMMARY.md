# Worksheet 09

## Overview

Week 9 calculus tutorial worksheet from MATH1014 Semester 2 2014 (October 21-24). Contains two problems focusing on multivariable calculus: verifying the fundamental solution to the Laplace equation satisfies the PDE ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² = 0, and using the chain rule to find df/dt for a function defined on a parametric ellipse. LaTeX source files include both the problem sheet and solution sheet with detailed worked solutions.
