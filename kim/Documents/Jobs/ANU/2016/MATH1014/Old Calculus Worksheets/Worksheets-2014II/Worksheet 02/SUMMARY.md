# Worksheet 02

## Overview

MATH1014 Calculus worksheet for week 2 (August 12-15, 2014), covering area calculations and volumes of revolution. Contains a single problem with two parts: (a) finding the area of a region bounded by y=2/x², y=0, x=2, and x=5; and (b) finding the volume of the solid formed by rotating that region around y=-2. The worksheet includes both the LaTeX source for the problem and a PDF with complete worked solutions showing integration techniques and the washer method for volumes of revolution.
