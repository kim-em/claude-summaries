# Worksheet 10

## Overview

Final worksheet for MATH1014 Calculus Semester 2 2014 (October 28-31). Focuses on multivariable calculus optimization, specifically finding and classifying critical points using the Hessian matrix and second derivative test. Contains a single comprehensive problem working through the complete process: computing partial derivatives to find critical points, constructing the Hessian matrix, and applying the discriminant test to classify each critical point as a local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.
