# Worksheet 08

## Overview

MATH1014 calculus tutorial worksheet for week 8 (October 14-17, 2014) focusing exclusively on polar coordinates. Contains two problems: calculating the area enclosed by a cardioid curve (r = 2 + 2cos θ) and computing the arc length of a circular polar curve (r = 2cos θ). The worksheet is provided as LaTeX source files for both the problem sheet and the solution sheet with detailed step-by-step solutions.
