# LectureNotes

## Overview

Comprehensive lecture notes for an Analysis 3 course covering functional analysis and measure theory. The course progresses from Hilbert spaces and functional calculus through measure theory, integration, and advanced topics in spectral theory and Banach spaces. Each topic is presented as a LaTeX source file (.tex) with corresponding compiled PDF, covering 14 sequential chapters that build from foundational concepts to advanced operator theory.
