# Assignment3Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 3 (2016), covering measure theory topics including distribution functions, pushforward measures, Fatou's Lemma, and convergence in measure. Contains 10 ungraded PDF submissions and a graded folder with 19 annotated PDFs showing detailed instructor feedback with handwritten comments, checkmarks, and numerical scores (e.g., 77/80, 95/100). The graded folder includes submissions from students who appear in the ungraded set plus additional students who may have submitted late or through different channels.
