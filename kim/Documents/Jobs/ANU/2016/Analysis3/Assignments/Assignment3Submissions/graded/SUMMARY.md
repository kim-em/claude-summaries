## Overview

Graded student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 3 (2016) with comprehensive instructor feedback. Contains 19 annotated PDFs with handwritten comments, checkmarks, and numerical scores. Feedback includes detailed critiques of mathematical rigor, proof techniques, and completeness across problems on distribution functions, pushforward measures, Fatou's Lemma variants, and convergence in measure. Scores range from mid-range (43/80, 59/100) to high marks (95/100), with point deductions noted for specific issues like insufficient justification, notation errors, and incomplete proofs.
