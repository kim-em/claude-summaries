# Assignments

## Overview

Complete assignment collection for MATH3325 Analysis 3 (2016), documenting the full pedagogical cycle from problem design through grading and student performance analysis. Four assignments progress systematically through the course's theoretical arc: bounded linear transformations and compact operators on Hilbert spaces (Assignment 1, due Aug 12); Fourier analysis, wave equation PDEs, and function space density (Assignment 2, due Sep 2); measure theory, Fatou's Lemma, and convergence modes (Assignment 3, due Sep 30); and spectral theory, weak/weak-* topologies, and the closed graph theorem (Assignment 4, due Nov 4). Each assignment was worth 100 marks (80 for mathematical content, 20 for exposition).

The submissions reveal a grading workflow where students submitted PDFs (mix of LaTeX typeset and handwritten scans), which were then moved into graded subdirectories with extensive red-pen annotations addressing proof rigor, notation conventions, theorem application, and common conceptual errors. Performance varied substantially: Assignment 1 graded submissions ranged 33-64/80 (41-80%), Assignment 2 showed scores like 47.5/60 and 22/82, and Assignment 3 demonstrated the widest spread (43/80 to 95/100). Instructor feedback consistently emphasized mathematical rigor (justifying Fubini-Tonelli, avoiding logical gaps), proper notation (no apostrophes in math, no starting sentences with symbols), and completeness of arguments.

The unreleased-solutions folder preserves alternative solution approaches and comprehensive Assignment 4 solutions (18 pages) that were never distributed to students, contrasting with the released sample solutions for Assignments 1-3 found in the parent directory. These materials suggest continuous refinement of solution presentations and retention of instructor reference materials for future course iterations.
