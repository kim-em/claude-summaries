# Assignments

## Overview

Four assignments for MATH3325 Analysis 3 (2016), each worth 100 marks (80 for problems, 20 for writing quality). Topics progress from Hilbert space operators and compact operators (Assignment 1), to Fourier analysis and PDEs (Assignment 2), measure theory and convergence (Assignment 3), and spectral theory and weak topologies (Assignment 4). Each assignment includes LaTeX source, compiled PDF, sample solutions PDF, and a submissions folder containing student work. Assignment 4 lacks released sample solutions.
