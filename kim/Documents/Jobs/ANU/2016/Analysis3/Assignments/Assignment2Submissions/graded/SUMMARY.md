## Overview

Graded student submissions for MATH6212/MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 2 with instructor feedback, annotations, and numerical scores. Contains 20 PDFs (65MB total) covering Fourier analysis topics including L¹/L² convergence, Fourier transforms, wave equation PDEs, compactly supported functions, and convolution properties. Submissions show detailed red/green ink markings indicating corrections, point deductions, and grading comments. Scores visible include fractional marks (e.g., 47.5/60, 35/60, 22/82) and percentage calculations. Mix of named student files and university ID files (u-prefixed).
