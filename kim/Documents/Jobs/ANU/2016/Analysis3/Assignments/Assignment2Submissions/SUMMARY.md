# Assignment2Submissions

## Overview

Complete submission and grading archive for MATH6212/MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 2 (due September 2, 2016). Contains 12 ungraded student PDFs (10.5MB) in the root directory representing initial submissions, plus a graded subdirectory with 20 annotated PDFs (65MB) showing instructor feedback, corrections in red/green ink, and numerical scores (e.g., 47.5/60, 22/82). Topics covered include Fourier transforms in L¹ and L², wave equation PDEs, compactly supported and Schwartz functions, convolution properties, and L∞ density proofs. The graded folder includes both named student files and university ID submissions, with visible annotations noting late penalties, point deductions, notational issues, and feedback on proof techniques in functional analysis.
