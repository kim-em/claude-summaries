## Overview

Subset of 5 graded student submissions from MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 1 (due August 12, 2016) with instructor feedback. Each PDF contains the student's original solutions annotated with red-pen corrections, comments, and scores. Submissions cover problems on completeness of L(H), bounded linear transformations, strong convergence, compact operators, self-adjoint operators, and integral operators. Grading style includes circled point scores per question, marginal notes highlighting errors, and detailed feedback on proof technique and mathematical rigor.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Michael Joseph.pdf` | Graded submission (2.6MB, 10 pages) - Score 64/80 (80%). Handwritten solutions on lined paper with red-pen feedback noting "Mostly good writing, although some careless errors in calculations" and requesting clearer explanation of steps. Questions on completeness of L(H), strong convergence, compact operators (with Cauchy-Schwarz application), and self-adjoint operators. Detailed marginal annotations pointing out algebraic errors and suggesting improvements. |
| `Jianing Zhao.pdf` | Graded submission (3.6MB, 12 pages) - Score 33/80 (41%). Handwritten solutions on green paper with extensive red-pen corrections. Multiple "Why?" annotations querying student's reasoning, notes on incorrect use of Fubini's theorem, and comments about missing arguments. Questions cover L(H) completeness, integral operators, compact operators, and self-adjoint operators. Heavy feedback on logical gaps and incomplete proofs. |
| `David Quarel.pdf` | Graded submission (10.8MB, 30 pages) - largest file, likely scanned handwritten work with detailed annotations |
| `John Hartman.pdf` | Graded submission (9.6MB, 26 pages) - substantial handwritten submission with instructor feedback |
| `Haui-jie Yao.pdf` | Graded submission (3.7MB, 28 pages) - handwritten solutions with grading annotations |
