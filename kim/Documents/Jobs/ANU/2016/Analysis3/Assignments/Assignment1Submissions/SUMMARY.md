# Assignment1Submissions

## Overview

Complete collection of student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 1 (due August 12, 2016). Contains 18 ungraded PDF submissions from students working on problems about bounded linear transformations on Hilbert spaces, strong convergence, compact operators, self-adjoint operators, and integral operators. Submissions range from 136KB to 6.1MB and include both typeset (LaTeX) solutions and handwritten work. The `graded/` subdirectory contains 5 graded submissions with detailed instructor feedback - scores ranging from 33/80 (41%) to 64/80 (80%), demonstrating the grading criteria focused on mathematical rigor, proof technique, and clarity of explanation. The graded work includes extensive red-pen annotations highlighting common student errors in applying Fubini's theorem, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and logical gaps in completeness arguments.

## Key Files
