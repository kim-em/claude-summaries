# Assignment1Submissions

## Overview

Student submissions for MATH3325 Analysis 3 Assignment 1 (due August 12, 2016). Contains 18 PDF submissions from students working on problems about bounded linear transformations on Hilbert spaces, strong convergence, compact operators, self-adjoint operators, and integral operators. Submissions range from 136KB to 6.1MB and include both typeset (LaTeX) solutions and handwritten work. A separate `graded/` subdirectory contains 5 graded submissions with instructor feedback and marks.

## Key Files
