# unreleased-solutions

## Overview

This directory contains unreleased solution materials for MATH3325 Analysis 3 (2016), including alternative solutions to old assignment problems and LaTeX source files for sample solutions. These materials were not distributed to students, in contrast to the released sample solutions found in the parent directory. The folder includes handwritten solutions to old problems for Assignments 1 and 4, plus LaTeX source files and compiled PDFs for Assignments 2 and 3 sample solutions (which differ from the released versions in the parent directory).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Assignment1-solutions-to-old-problems.pdf` | Handwritten solutions (2 pages) to old Assignment 1 problems on orthogonal projections in Hilbert spaces: proving P₁+P₂ is an orthogonal projection when P₁ and P₂ have orthogonal ranges, and proving that operators with orthogonal ranges all have norm ≤1 |
| `Assignment2-sample-solutions.pdf` | Alternate compiled sample solutions (1 page, 21KB) for Assignment 2, covering wave equation Fourier transform solution |
| `Assignment2-sample-solutions.tex` | LaTeX source for Assignment 2 alternate solutions: solving wave equation via Fourier transform (showing û_tt = -\|ξ\|² û, proving û is Schwartz, and verifying energy conservation in L²(ℝ³)) |
| `Assignment3-sample-solutions.pdf` | Alternate compiled sample solutions (4 pages, 56KB) for Assignment 3, covering measure theory topics |
| `Assignment3-sample-solutions.tex` | LaTeX source (167 lines) for Assignment 3 alternate solutions: Dynkin π-λ theorem for measure agreement, upper density and convergence in measure, dominated convergence theorem with essential boundedness, and proof that L¹ convergence implies convergence in measure but not vice versa with counterexamples |
| `Assignment4-sample-solutions.pdf` | Comprehensive sample solutions (18 pages, 872KB) for Assignment 4 covering spectral theory, weak topology, and Banach space theory—notably these were never released to students (Assignment 4 lacks released sample solutions in parent directory) |
| `Assignment4-solutions-to-old-problems.pdf` | Handwritten solutions (15 pages, 229KB) to old Assignment 4 problems: proving properties of unitary operators U (showing U*U=UU*=I and computing spectrum), analyzing spectrum of self-adjoint operators (showing σ(A-kI)⊂ℝ_{≥0} when A≥kI), proving A^n-I is positive when A≥I, proving closed graph theorem for Banach space maps, evaluation map continuity, weak-* convergence to Dirac measure, and constructing convex decreasing sets with non-empty intersection and weak-* closure properties |
