# Assignment4Submissions

## Overview

Complete submission and grading workflow for Assignment 4 of MATH3325 Analysis 3 (2016), the final assignment of the course covering advanced functional analysis topics including self-adjoint operators, spectral theory, closed graph theorem, weak topology, and weak-* convergence (due Nov 4). The folder contains 11 original ungraded PDF submissions at the top level, plus a graded subdirectory with 17 annotated PDFs showing detailed instructor feedback and scoring. The graded versions are notably larger (900KB to 7MB) than originals due to handwritten annotations and corrections. Six students appear only in the graded folder (Elliot Herrington, Greg Sukochev, Li Feng, Nge Kie Seng, Yanbai Zhang, Ye Hanxuan), suggesting they submitted through a different channel or the originals were moved.
