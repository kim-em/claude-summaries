# EssayDrafts

## Overview

Draft essay submissions from 15 students in MATH3325 Analysis 3 (Semester 2, 2016), each with instructor-annotated versions showing detailed feedback.

The folder contains 29 files totaling approximately 29MB: original student submissions plus annotated versions with extensive marginal comments and corrections from the instructor. One submission (Greg Sukochev) is in DOC format; all others are PDFs.
