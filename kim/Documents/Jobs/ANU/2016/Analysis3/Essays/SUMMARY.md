## Overview

Complete essay assignment workflow for MATH3325 Analysis 3 (Semester 2, 2016), documenting the full pedagogical cycle: assignment specification (15 suggested research topics including Dirichlet problems, fractal dimension, wavelets, Fourier transform inversion, trace class operators, Hilbert transform, Brownian motion, ergodic theory, and fixed point theorems), quality exemplars from previous years (2009-2013), draft feedback process with detailed instructor annotations for 15 students, and final submissions from 19 students covering diverse topics in functional analysis, stochastic processes, and fractal geometry.

The folder provides unusual insight into both excellent teaching practice and academic integrity challenges. The pedagogical approach emphasizes peer-appropriate exposition ("audience of MATH3325 peers"), substantial commentary on drafts (annotated PDFs averaging 2MB, with detailed marginal feedback on mathematical rigor, notation clarity, and proof structure), and calibrated exemplars demonstrating expected scope and quality across different proof techniques and mathematical domains.

The "cheater" folder documents a particularly well-evidenced case of systematic contract cheating, where Michael Chappuis commissioned essays through Freelancer.com across multiple mathematics courses (MATH3325, MATH3015, MATH3349). The case is notable for capturing the complete lifecycle of academic fraud: the Freelancer.com job posting offering $90-110 USD for a functional analysis essay with 48-hour deadline, the extensive 40MB+ reference package provided to bidding freelancers (including insider-only annotated example essays and prescribed textbooks), pattern-matching between Freelancer.com instructions and verbatim personalized guidance from the instructor, bank transaction records, and systematic documentation by three professors of the student's inability to explain fundamental concepts during in-person verification meetings. This represents comprehensive evidentiary documentation suitable for formal misconduct proceedings.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `EssayTopics.tex` | LaTeX source defining essay requirements (5-8 pages, mostly words, clear goal, audience of MATH3325 peers) and suggesting 15 research topics spanning applied analysis (Dirichlet problem, wavelets, FFT), operator theory (trace class, Hilbert transform), probability (Brownian motion, ergodic theory), and topology (fixed point theorems) |
| `EssayTopics.pdf` | Compiled PDF of essay topics and requirements (14KB) |

## Subdirectories

- [x] `EssayDrafts/` - Draft submissions from 15 students with extensive instructor annotations (29 files, 29MB total), demonstrating thorough pedagogical feedback process: annotated PDFs average 2MB with handwritten marginal comments on mathematical exposition, notation clarity, rigor, and proof structure (e.g., "maybe spell out what you mean here", corrections to mathematical notation). Topics centered on stochastic integration, semimartingales, and Bichteler-Dellacherie theorem. One submission (Greg Sukochev) in DOC format; all others PDF.
- [x] `EssayExamples/` - Four carefully curated exemplars from previous years (2009-2013) calibrating student expectations across diverse proof techniques and mathematical domains: trace class operators/Lidskii's theorem using antisymmetric tensor products (Tom Phelan 2009, 11 pages), representation theory of compact groups/Peter-Weyl theorem (Ben Lim 2013, 6 pages), Fourier-Stieltjes transform/Bochner's theorem (Yitao Lei 2013, 9 pages), and fixed point theorems with Nash equilibrium applications (Hannah Keese 2013, 8 pages). Demonstrates expected scope, rigor, and expository style.
- [x] `FinalEssays/` - Final essay submissions from 19 students (12MB total) covering functional analysis (Gelfand-Naimark theorem for C*-algebras, stochastic integration/semimartingales), fractal geometry (Hausdorff and similarity dimensions, box-counting dimensions), and stochastic processes (fractional Brownian motion). Notably includes 8.1MB submission from Michael Chappuis on fractional Brownian motion in infinite dimensional spaces—the subject of the contract cheating case documented in cheater/ folder.
- [x] `cheater/` - Comprehensive evidentiary package documenting systematic contract cheating by Michael Chappuis across multiple courses (MATH3325, MATH3015, MATH3349): Freelancer.com job posting (Project 11870829, $90-110 USD, 48hr deadline), complete 40MB+ reference package provided to bidders (insider-only annotated example essays, prescribed textbooks, LaTeX templates), freelancer-delivered essay, bank transaction records, chat transcripts obtaining Freelancer.com refunds (user "Ravi Kumar"), formal November 22, 2016 allegation letter from three professors (Barnsley, Morrison, Portal) with 11 labeled attachments, and detailed documentation of in-person verification meetings where student couldn't explain B(H) notation, misstated Riesz lemma, or describe Hilbert theorem from weeks 2-3. Represents complete lifecycle documentation from commission through formal misconduct proceedings.
