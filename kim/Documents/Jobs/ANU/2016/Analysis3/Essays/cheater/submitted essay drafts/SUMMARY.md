# submitted essay drafts

## Overview

Student draft submissions of an essay on fractional Brownian motion in infinite dimensional spaces, heavily annotated by the instructor with critical comments questioning fundamental understanding. The folder contains two versions of the same essay (dated October 20 and October 26, 2016) with extensive marginal annotations highlighting conceptual errors and misuse of mathematical notation, plus detailed notes from an October 26 in-person meeting where the student was unable to explain basic functional analysis concepts (B(H) notation, Riesz lemma, Hilbert theorem) appearing in the submitted work, strongly suggesting the student did not write or understand the essay.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Michael Chappuis - comments.pdf` | First annotated draft (October 20, 2016, 1.65MB, 5 pages) with instructor's handwritten margin comments including "Mention here it is usual Brownian motion", "Recall we defined a fractional Brownian motion without cov fn!", "Is Enough? Rigorous Enough", circled questions marks, and notes about improper definitions and missing rigor |
| `Michael Chappuis - draft 2.pdf` | Second revised draft (October 26, 2016, 1.19MB, 18 pages) - cleaner essay on fractional Brownian motion covering Kolmogorov's theorem, Gaussian measures in Hilbert spaces, Q-Brownian motion construction, and stochastic integration, but with similar fundamental issues |
| `Notes on Michael's draft #2.txt` | Critical documentation (2.3KB) from instructor's October 26 meeting detailing three specific instances where student couldn't explain concepts: (1) failed to recognize B(H) as bounded operators on Hilbert space despite constant course usage, (2) incorrectly stated Riesz lemma as trivial/meaningless proposition, (3) couldn't explain Hilbert theorem (compact operators have orthonormal eigenvector basis) despite it being covered in week 2-3 of course; concludes "almost any step...could be queried, and he would have minimal or nonexistent understanding" and notes reference list matches Freelancer.com job posting |
