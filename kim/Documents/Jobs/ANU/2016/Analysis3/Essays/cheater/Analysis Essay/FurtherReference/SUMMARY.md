# FurtherReference

## Overview

Collection of three advanced graduate-level reference textbooks on stochastic processes and stochastic partial differential equations, all exceeding Claude's reading limits (148-514 pages). These books provide comprehensive mathematical foundations for the infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis required in the essay assignment, covering stochastic PDEs, stochastic equations in infinite dimensions, and rigorous Brownian motion theory.
