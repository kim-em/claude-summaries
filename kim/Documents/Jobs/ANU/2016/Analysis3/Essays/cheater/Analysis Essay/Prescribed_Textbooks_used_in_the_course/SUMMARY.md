# Prescribed_Textbooks_used_in_the_course

## Overview

Contains the two prescribed textbooks for the MATH3325 Functional Analysis course by Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi, both from Princeton University Press. These are the primary reference materials students were expected to use for the course, covering functional analysis and real analysis foundations necessary for understanding the essay assignment on fractional Brownian motion in infinite dimensions.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `[Elias_M._Stein,_Rami_Shakarchi]_Functional_Analysis.pdf` | Prescribed textbook on functional analysis (12.1MB, too large to read) - covers Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, operator theory, and other foundations needed for the course |
| `[Elias_M._Stein,_Rami_Shakarchi]_Real_Analysis.pdf` | Prescribed textbook on real analysis (2.7MB) - covers measure theory, integration, and analysis foundations that underpin functional analysis |
