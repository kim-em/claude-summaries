# Reference_Articles_Listed_in_Desprition_of_the_essay

## Overview

Nine academic research articles on fractional Brownian motion (fBm) theory, construction methods, stochastic calculus, and applications, all in PDF format ranging from 146KB to 529KB (22-29 pages each). The collection includes the foundational 1968 Mandelbrot & Van Ness paper introducing fractional Brownian motions as a family of Gaussian processes with the Hurst parameter H, plus contemporary (2006-era) papers on stochastic calculus techniques including Malliavin calculus, rough path construction using Volterra representations, PDE connections, time fractional processes, and fractal dimension analysis for continuous time random walks.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Fractional Brownian motions, fractional noises and applications (M & Van Ness 1968).pdf` | Foundational SIAM Review paper (529KB, 29 pages) introducing fractional Brownian motions as moving averages of ordinary Brownian motion weighted by kernel (t-s)^(H-1/2), defining self-affinity properties, stationary increments, and applications to economics, hydrology (Hurst's law), and 1/f noise phenomena |
| `Fractional Brownian motion - stochastic calculus and applications.pdf` | Nualart's 2006 survey (146KB, 22 pages) from International Congress of Mathematicians covering stochastic calculus via pathwise Young integrals and Malliavin calculus techniques, with applications to turbulence (vortex filament energy) and mathematical finance (fractional Black-Scholes model, stochastic volatility) |
| `Stochastic Analysis of the Fractional Brownian Motion By L. Decreusefond and A. S. Ustunel.pdf` | Research article (285KB) on stochastic analysis framework for fBm using Malliavin calculus and anticipative calculus techniques |
| `A CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROUGH PATH ABOVE FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN MOTION USING VOLTERRA'S REPRESENTATION.pdf` | Technical paper (310KB) presenting rough path theory construction above fBm using Volterra integral representations, enabling stochastic differential equations driven by fBm for H ∈ (1/4, 1/2) |
| `CONSTRUCTION_1_A CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROUGH PATH ABOVE FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN MOTION USING VOLTERRA'S REPRESENTATION.pdf` | Duplicate or variant of the Volterra rough path construction paper (310KB, nearly identical file size suggests duplicate content) |
| `Time Fractional Brownian Motion- PDE Connections and Local Times.pdf` | Article (246KB, 29 pages) exploring connections between time fractional Brownian motion and partial differential equations, including analysis of local times |
| `ARTICLE_2_-Time Fractional Brownian Motion- PDE Connections and Local Times.pdf` | Duplicate copy of the time fractional Brownian motion PDE paper (246KB, identical size) |
| `052fractionalBrownianMotions.pdf` | Research paper (529KB, 29 pages) on fractional Brownian motion theory and properties (nearly identical size to Mandelbrot & Van Ness suggests possible duplicate or related comprehensive treatment) |
| `FRACTAL DIMENSIONS FOR CONTINUOUS TIME RANDOM WALK LIMITS.pdf` | Paper (276KB) analyzing fractal dimensional properties of limiting processes from continuous time random walks, connecting to fractional processes |
