# Analysis_Essays_Example_PreviousYears

## Overview

Collection of four annotated example essays from previous MATH3325 (Functional Analysis) students, provided as reference materials to demonstrate different quality levels and approaches. Each PDF (ranging from 6-11 pages, 231-373KB) showcases student work on advanced mathematical topics including trace class operators (Lidskii's Theorem), compact Lie groups (Peter-Weyl Theorem), Fourier analysis (Bochner's Theorem), and topology (fixed point theorems), with instructor feedback indicating varying degrees of rigor, completeness, and mathematical style.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Example1_Good_Detail_but_it_should_more_rigourous_PRINT.pdf` | 11-page essay on "Trace Class Operators and Lidskii's Theorem" by Tom Phelan (2009) covering Hilbert space operators, polar decomposition, antisymmetric tensor products, and determinant functions; demonstrates good detail but instructor notes it should be more rigorous |
| `Example2_GoodStyle_but_Not_Complet_Enough_PRINT.pdf` | 6-page essay on "The Peter-Weyl Theorem" by Ben Lim (2013) proving matrix coefficients are dense in L²(G) for compact Hausdorff groups, using Haar measures, convolution operators, and the Spectral Theorem; instructor notes good expository style but insufficient completeness |
| `Example3_Detailed_but_Not_rigourous_Enough_PRINT.pdf` | 9-page essay on "Bochner's Theorem on the Fourier Transform on ℝ" by Yitao Lei (2013) extending Fourier transforms to complex measures, covering Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, positive-definite functions, and Herglotz's theorem on the torus; instructor notes detailed exposition but lacks sufficient mathematical rigor |
| `Example4_Almost_Complet_but_it_could_have_beeen_a_bit_more_rigourous_PRIN.pdf` | 8-page essay on "Fixed Point Theorems" by Hannah Keese covering Markov-Kakutani and Kakutani fixed point theorems with applications to game theory and Nash equilibrium; instructor notes nearly complete work that could be slightly more rigorous |
