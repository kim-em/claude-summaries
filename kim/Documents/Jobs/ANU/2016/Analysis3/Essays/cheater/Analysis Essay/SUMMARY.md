# Analysis Essay

## Overview

Complete reference package provided to the hired freelancer for a functional analysis essay on fractional Brownian motion in infinite dimensions, commissioned via Freelancer.com in September 2016. The package comprises the 6-page assignment specification requiring rigorous mathematical construction of fractional Brownian motion (Part 1) and survey of connections to stochastic analysis (Part 2), a LaTeX template for students unfamiliar with LaTeX, four annotated example essays from previous MATH3325 students demonstrating varying quality levels (detailed vs rigorous, complete vs stylistic), comprehensive reference materials totaling over 40MB including the two prescribed course textbooks (Stein & Shakarchi's Functional Analysis and Real Analysis), duplicate collections of three advanced stochastic process textbooks (Prévôt & Röckner, Da Prato & Zabczyk, Schilling et al.), five additional reference books including Biagini et al. on stochastic calculus for fBm and concise construction notes by Mark H.A. Davis, and nine research articles led by the foundational 1968 Mandelbrot & Van Ness paper introducing fractional Brownian motions, plus contemporary papers on Malliavin calculus, rough path theory via Volterra representations, PDE connections, and fractal dimensions.

The collection reveals systematic preparation for outsourcing: example essays calibrate expectations for rigor and completeness (instructor feedback explicitly noting "should be more rigorous," "not complete enough"), the assignment emphasizes "pure mathematician rigour" and detailed explanations, and the extensive reference library (36.6MB of textbooks plus 2.9MB of research articles) provided the freelancer with both introductory materials (Davis's 6-page construction notes using Haar functions and Lévy-Ciesielski method) and advanced research literature covering all topics mentioned in the assignment (Gaussian processes, Hurst parameter, stochastic calculus techniques, rough paths, applications to finance and PDEs).
