# Analysis Essay

## Overview

Complete reference materials package provided to the hired freelancer for the functional analysis essay commissioned via Freelancer.com. Contains the essay assignment requirements PDF (FunctionalAnalysisEssay_UPDATED.pdf, 6 pages) outlining a two-part essay on fractional Brownian motion in infinite dimensions with rigorous mathematical construction requirements, a LaTeX template file, four example essays from previous years demonstrating different quality levels (good detail, good style, detailed but not rigorous enough, almost complete), extensive reference materials including prescribed textbooks (Stein & Shakarchi's Functional Analysis and Real Analysis), multiple reference books on stochastic processes and fractional Brownian motion (Prévôt & Röckner, Da Prato & Zabczyk, Schilling et al., Biagini et al., Rogers & Williams, Mörters & Peres, Falconer), and nine reference articles covering fractional Brownian motion construction methods, stochastic analysis, rough paths, and PDE connections.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `FunctionalAnalysisEssay_UPDATED.pdf` | Assignment specification (79KB, 6 pages) dated September 2016 requiring rigorous construction of fractional Brownian motion in infinite dimension (Part 1) plus survey of connections to stochastic analysis topics (Part 2), emphasizing "pure mathematician rigour" and detailed explanations |
| `TemplateAnalysisEssay.tex` | LaTeX template (2.7KB) demonstrating basic LaTeX document structure, math mode usage, theorem environments, and cross-referencing system for students unfamiliar with LaTeX |

## Subdirectories

- [x] `Analysis_Essays_Example_PreviousYears/` - Four example essays from previous MATH3325 students (231KB-373KB PDFs) with instructor annotations: Example1 (good detail but should be more rigorous), Example2 (good style but not complete enough), Example3 (detailed but not rigorous enough), Example4 (almost complete but could be more rigorous) (complete)
- [x] `FurtherReference/` - Three advanced reference books on stochastic processes: Prévôt & Röckner's "A Concise Course on Stochastic Partial Differential Equations" (1.1MB, 148 pages), Da Prato & Zabczyk's "Stochastic Equations in Infinite Dimensions" (2.5MB, 514 pages), and Schilling, Partzsch & Brown's "Brownian Motion: An Introduction to Stochastic Processes" (12.4MB, 396 pages) - all too large to read (complete)
