# Analysis_Essays_Example_PreviousYears

## Overview

This folder contains four example essays from previous years of an ANU Analysis 3 course, provided as reference materials for a functional analysis essay assignment. Each PDF is annotated with evaluative comments indicating the essay's strengths and areas for improvement. The examples demonstrate various levels of mathematical rigor, completeness, and presentation style, serving as benchmarks for students attempting the assignment on constructing Fractional Brownian Motion in infinite dimension.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Example1_Good_Detail_but_it_should_more_rigourous_PRINT.pdf | Student essay on "Trace Class Operators and Lidskii's Theorem" by Tom Phelan (2009) - demonstrates good detail in exposition but lacks complete mathematical rigor in some proofs |
| Example2_GoodStyle_but_Not_Complet_Enough_PRINT.pdf | Student essay on "The Peter-Weyl Theorem" by Ben Lim (2013) - exhibits good writing style and clear presentation but insufficient depth of coverage for the assignment requirements |
| Example3_Detailed_but_Not_rigourous_Enough_PRINT.pdf | Student essay on "Bochner's Theorem on the Fourier Transform on R" by Yitao Lei (2013) - provides detailed exposition but lacks the level of mathematical rigor expected for the assignment |
| Example4_Almost_Complet_but_it_could_have_beeen_a_bit_more_rigourous_PRIN.pdf | Student essay on "Fixed Point Theorems" by Hannah Keese - nearly complete coverage with good rigor, though some proofs could be more thorough; closest to meeting the assignment standards |
