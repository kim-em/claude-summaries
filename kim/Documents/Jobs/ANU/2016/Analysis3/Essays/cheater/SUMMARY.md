## Overview

Comprehensive documentation of an academic misconduct case involving student Michael Chappuis (ID 5831072) who systematically commissioned essays through Freelancer.com for multiple mathematics courses (MATH3325 Functional Analysis, MATH3015 Mathematics of Finance, MATH3349 Reading Course) during 2016. This folder represents a complete evidentiary package demonstrating contract cheating at scale, with the case built on multiple converging lines of evidence.

The case is particularly well-documented because it captures the entire lifecycle of academic fraud: the initial Freelancer.com job posting (Project ID 11870829, offering $90-110 USD for a 10-12 page functional analysis essay with 48-hour deadline), the extensive reference package provided to bidding freelancers (over 40MB of course materials including insider-only example essays with instructor quality annotations, prescribed textbooks, advanced reference materials, and LaTeX template), the freelancer-delivered essay, pattern-matching between Freelancer.com instructions and personalized in-person guidance from Dr Portal (including verbatim phrases like "breadth rather than depth"), and systematic documentation by three professors of the student's inability to explain fundamental concepts from their own submissions.

Supporting evidence includes bank transaction records documenting payments to Freelancer.com, chat transcripts where user "Ravi Kumar" (using email ravi.math2013+freelancer@gmail.com) obtained refunds for Freelancer.com membership fees, the student's CV claiming positions at Oxford-Man Institute and Columbia, and the formal November 22, 2016 allegation letter from Profs Barnsley, Morrison, and Portal with 11 labeled attachments. The most damaging evidence comes from instructor meetings where the student couldn't identify B(H) as bounded operators despite constant course usage, misstated the Riesz lemma, and failed to explain the Hilbert theorem covered in weeks 2-3, concluding that "almost any step...could be queried, and he would have minimal or nonexistent understanding."

Davis, and nine research articles (2.9MB) led by the foundational 1968 Mandelbrot & Van Ness paper introducing fractional Brownian motions, plus contemporary papers on Malliavin calculus, rough path theory, PDE connections, and fractal dimensions
- [x] `case/` - Formal allegation package documenting misconduct charges across three courses (MATH3325, MATH3015, MATH3349), centered on the November 22, 2016 allegation letter from Profs Barnsley, Morrison, and Portal with 11 labeled attachments (A-K): the original Freelancer.com job posting screenshots, the freelancer-delivered essay, sample essays from previous students proving insider access to course materials, Dr Portal's statement that Freelancer.com instructions exactly match specific personalized guidance given in person (including verbatim phrases), the student's three submitted essays, A/Prof Morrison's notes from October 26 meeting documenting inability to explain fundamental concepts (B(H) notation, Riesz lemma, Hilbert theorem), Prof Barnsley's statement about photographing blackboard counterexamples rather than understanding them, Dr Portal's comment that submitted 32-page MATH3015 essay is written at level "much higher than undergraduate courses (or even Masters level courses) taught at ANU," complete 136-page combined package (15.5MB), student CV claiming research positions at Oxford-Man Institute and Columbia, official ANU transcript, Freelancer.com reputation screenshot, and subfolder with complete instructions posted on Freelancer.com
- [x] `submitted essay drafts/` - Two versions of the student's essay on fractional Brownian motion (October 20 and October 26, 2016, 1.65MB and 1.19MB) heavily annotated by instructor with critical margin comments highlighting conceptual errors and notation misuse, plus detailed notes from the October 26 in-person verification meeting documenting three specific instances where the student failed to explain basic functional analysis concepts: couldn't recognize B(H) as bounded operators on Hilbert space despite constant course usage, incorrectly stated Riesz lemma as trivial/meaningless proposition, and couldn't explain Hilbert theorem (compact operators have orthonormal eigenvector basis) despite week 2-3 coverage, with instructor concluding "almost any step...could be queried, and he would have minimal or nonexistent understanding" and noting reference list matches Freelancer.com posting
