# PastProblemSets

## Overview

Archive of problem sets from earlier offerings of MATH3325 Analysis 3, specifically from 2010 and 2012 vintages. Contains five LaTeX source files covering advanced topics in measure theory, functional analysis, and weak topology that were not included in the 2016 course materials. These appear to be source files only (no compiled PDFs or solutions included), representing different pedagogical approaches and topic selections from previous years.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `probset4.tex` | Problem Set 4 from 2012 (Sept 3 tutorial): 4 problems on measure theory including measure defined by integration with respect to another measure, translation-invariant measures on R^n and uniqueness of Lebesgue measure, independence of simple function integral representation, and absolute continuity examples |
| `probset5.tex` | Problem Set 5 from 2012 (Oct 3 tutorial): 4 problems on measure theory including measurable sets occurring infinitely often, absolutely continuous functions and measures, singular measures without atoms, and Radon-Nikodym theorem counterexamples with counting measure |
| `prob05.tex` | Problem Set 5 from 2010 (Oct 18 tutorial): 7 problems on weak topology in Banach spaces including unboundedness of open sets in σ(X,X*)-topology, weak convergence of orthonormal bases in Hilbert spaces, characterization of weak convergence, and density results for dual spaces |
| `probset6.tex` | Problem Set 6 from 2012 (Oct 15 tutorial): 6 problems on Hausdorff dimension, fractals (IFS with similitudes), inequivalent norms on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, completeness of quotient Banach spaces, dual of C([0,1]), and redundant conditions in earlier assignments; includes commented-out Cantor set Hausdorff measure problem |
| `probset7.tex` | Problem Set 7 from 2012 (Oct 22 tutorial): 7 problems on weak topology nearly identical to prob05.tex but with modifications (Q2 about weakly convergent subsequences instead of convergence to zero, Q4 adds boundedness hypothesis with explanatory remark about Uniform Boundedness Principle) |
