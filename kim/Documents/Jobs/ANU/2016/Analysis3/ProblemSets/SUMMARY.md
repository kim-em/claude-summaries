# ProblemSets

## Overview

Complete set of problem sets for MATH3325 Analysis 3 (2016), including four current-year problem sets and an archive of past problem sets from earlier course offerings. The 2016 problem sets progress through core functional analysis topics: Hilbert space theory (closed subspaces, projections, bounded linear transformations, finite rank operators), Lp spaces demonstrating unique Hilbert space properties (closest point problems showing non-uniqueness in non-Hilbert Banach spaces), Fourier analysis (symmetry properties, Hermite functions as eigenfunctions, convolution approximations, central limit theorem), and Banach space theory (inequivalent norms, quotient spaces, dual space characterization). Each problem set includes student version PDF, handwritten hints/solutions PDF, and LaTeX source. The archive subfolder preserves five problem sets from 2010 and 2012 offerings that covered topics not included in 2016 (measure theory, Radon-Nikodym theorem, weak topology), showing the evolution of the course's pedagogical focus.

## Key Files
