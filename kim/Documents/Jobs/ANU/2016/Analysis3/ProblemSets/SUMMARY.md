# ProblemSets

## Overview

Four problem sets for MATH3325 Analysis 3 (2016), covering Hilbert space theory (closed subspaces, projections, bounded linear transformations, orthogonal projections, finite rank operators), Lp spaces and metric geometry (closest point problems in different Lp norms demonstrating non-uniqueness in non-Hilbert spaces), Fourier analysis (symmetry properties, Hermite functions as eigenfunctions, convolution approximations, central limit theorem), and Banach space theory (inequivalent norms, quotient spaces, dual space characterization). Each problem set includes both a student version PDF and a hints version PDF with handwritten solutions, plus LaTeX sources. Problem sets were discussed in tutorials on specific dates (July 25, August 1 & 8, August 21 & 29, October 19).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ProblemSet1.tex` | LaTeX source for Problem Set 1 (7 problems on Hilbert spaces: closed subspaces, projections, L1 vs L2 norms, bounded linear transformations, operator norm convergence, finite rank operators) |
| `ProblemSet1.pdf` | Compiled student version of Problem Set 1 for tutorial on July 25 |
| `ProblemSet1-hints.pdf` | Handwritten hints/solutions for Problem Set 1 (4 pages, 380KB) |
| `ProblemSet2.tex` | LaTeX source for Problem Set 2 (4 problems on closest point in Lp([0,1]) subspace for varying p, demonstrating existence/uniqueness differences between Hilbert and Banach spaces) |
| `ProblemSet2.pdf` | Compiled student version of Problem Set 2 for tutorials on August 1 and 8 |
| `ProblemSet2-hints.pdf` | Handwritten hints/solutions for Problem Set 2 (784KB) |

| `ProblemSet3.pdf` | Compiled student version of Problem Set 3 for tutorials on August 21 and 29 |
| `ProblemSet4.tex` | LaTeX source for Problem Set 4 (4 problems on Banach spaces: inequivalent inner products on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, quotient space completeness, dual of C([0,1]), redundant condition in assignment) with commented-out Hausdorff dimension and fractal questions |
