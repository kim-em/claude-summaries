# Analysis3

## Overview

Complete archive of MATH3325/MATH6214 Advanced Functional Analysis and Spectral Theory course from Semester 2, 2016 at ANU, taught to 23 students. The course provides comprehensive coverage of advanced real analysis topics including Hilbert space theory, compact operators, measure theory, integration theory, Radon-Nikodym derivatives, Stone-Weierstrass theorem, spectral theory, and Banach spaces, drawing primarily from Stein & Shakarchi's Real Analysis (Vol. III) chapters 4-6 and selected material from Functional Analysis (Vol. IV).

The archive captures the complete pedagogical workflow across all course components: 14 sequential lecture note modules progressing from functional calculus motivation through Hilbert/Banach space theory; 4 problem sets with handwritten instructor solutions; 4 substantial assignments (80 marks mathematics + 20 marks exposition) with comprehensive grading workflow showing scores ranging 33-95/100 and detailed feedback on proof rigor, notation, and theorem application; essay component with 15 curated topics, draft feedback process for 15 students, final submissions from 19 students, and complete documentation of a systematic contract cheating case via Freelancer.com; final exam with solutions, rejected problems, and 19 graded scripts; grade certification for both undergraduate (MATH3325, 11 students) and postgraduate (MATH6214, 12 students) sections showing final distribution of 6 HD, 2 D, 6 CR, 3 P, 2 F, 2 DA, 2 NCN; and summer session completion materials for Kyle Broder who finished all coursework November 2016-February 2017.

The materials reveal sophisticated pedagogical practices: peer-appropriate essay writing ("audience of MATH3325 peers"), extensive draft feedback with 2MB annotated PDFs, quality-calibrated exemplars from 2009-2013, systematic grading rubrics emphasizing mathematical rigor and exposition clarity, and preservation of alternative solutions and unused exam problems for future reference. The folder also documents significant challenges in academic integrity, with comprehensive evidentiary documentation of contract cheating including Freelancer.com job postings, reference packages, bank transactions, and formal misconduct allegations from three professors.
