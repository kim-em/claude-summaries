# Analysis3

## Overview

MATH3325 Analysis 3 course taught in Semester 2, 2016, with 23 enrolled students. The course covers advanced real analysis topics including Hilbert spaces, compact operators, measure theory, integration theory, Radon-Nikodym derivatives, Stone-Weierstrass theorem, spectral theory, and Banach spaces, based on Stein & Shakarchi's Real Analysis (Vol. III) chapters 4-6 and selected material from Functional Analysis (Vol. IV). The folder contains complete course materials including 14 lecture note PDFs, 4 problem sets, 4 assignments with submissions, essay requirements and submissions (including plagiarism case), final exam with solutions, reference textbooks, grading records, SELT evaluation form, and summer session work for one student (Kyle Broder) who completed coursework outside the regular semester.
