# 2015

## Overview

Materials for the 2015 Analysis 3 final exam, which was a 48-hour take-home exam with 5 questions (each worth 20 marks, with 10 bonus marks on question 5). The exam covered Hilbert space convergence, Fourier multiplier operators, weak-* topology on measure spaces, L^p norm inequalities, and weak convergence in reflexive Banach spaces. Students could submit answers to all 5 questions but only the best 4 questions plus writing quality (20 marks) counted toward the final grade of 100 marks.
