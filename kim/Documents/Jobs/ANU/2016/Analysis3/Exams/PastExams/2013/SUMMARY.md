## Overview

Final exam materials from the 2013 offering of MATH3325/MATH6214 (Analysis 3 Honours - Functional Analysis, Spectral Theory and Applications). The exam was a timed 3-hour exam worth 100 points total, with 6 problems covering measure theory, L^p spaces, spectrum of operators, compact self-adjoint operators, and weak convergence in Banach spaces. Also includes rejected questions that were considered but not used, along with detailed solutions to the final exam.
