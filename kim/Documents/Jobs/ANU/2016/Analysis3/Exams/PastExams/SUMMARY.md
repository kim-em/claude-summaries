# PastExams

## Overview

Archive of past final exams for Analysis 3 (MATH3325/MATH6214) from 2013-2015, organized by year. Each year contains the final exam PDF and LaTeX source, along with rejected problems and their solutions. The 2013 and 2014 exams were timed 3-hour exams covering functional analysis and spectral theory topics (measure spaces, L^p spaces, spectrum of operators, compact self-adjoint operators, weak convergence in Banach spaces). The 2015 exam was a 48-hour take-home exam with 5 questions on Hilbert space convergence, Fourier multiplier operators, atomic measures, L^p inequalities, and reflexive Banach spaces.
