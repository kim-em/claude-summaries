# PastExams

## Overview

Complete archive of past final exams for Analysis 3 (MATH3325/MATH6214) from 2013-2015, serving as reference materials for the 2016 course offering. The collection demonstrates the evolution of exam format from traditional timed exams to a take-home format. The 2013 and 2014 exams were both timed 3-hour exams with increasing complexity (100 points across 6 questions in 2013; 135 points across 10 questions plus take-home section in 2014), covering core functional analysis topics including measure theory, L^p spaces, spectral theory, compact operators, and weak convergence. The 2015 exam shifted to a 48-hour take-home format with 5 substantial questions (20 marks each) where students submitted all but were graded on their best 4 plus writing quality. All years include comprehensive solutions and collections of rejected/candidate problems that provide additional practice material.
