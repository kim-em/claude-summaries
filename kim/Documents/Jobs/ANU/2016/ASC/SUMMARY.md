# ASC

## Overview

Australian Summer Course (ASC) on Knot Theory co-taught by Scott Morrison and Zsuzsanna Dancso in 2016. This was an individual supervision course for Adele Jackson's PhB Advanced Studies Course project on knot theory, specifically focusing on the challenging topic of the homological construction of the Burau representation—notable for requiring knowledge of algebraic topology. Assessment involved written homework assignments, a final written report, and an oral presentation (presented at a group seminar). Both instructors provided independent assessments, with Jackson achieving an exceptional weighted average grade of 92% (Report: 88-94%, Oral: 88-91%, Assignments: 97%). The folder contains a blank marking template for another student (Samuel Quinn) who may have been considered for the course, along with complete assessment documentation for Jackson.
