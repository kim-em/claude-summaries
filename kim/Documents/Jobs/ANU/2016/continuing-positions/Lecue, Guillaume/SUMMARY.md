# Lecue, Guillaume

## Overview

Complete application package for Guillaume Lecué, a CNRS researcher at CREST-ENSAE (France) applying for the 2016 ANU continuing position in Mathematical Science. Lecué is a prominent mathematical statistician from Tsybakov's school specializing in empirical risk minimization, learning theory, compressed sensing, and high-dimensional statistics. The application demonstrates exceptional academic credentials: 26 publications in top-tier journals (Annals of Statistics, Bernoulli, IEEE Trans. Info Theory), prestigious awards including the Mark Fulk award (2006) and Prix de la chancellerie (€10,000, 2008), teaching positions at École Polytechnique and ENSAE, and industry consulting experience.

Particularly notable is the strong internal endorsement from Shahar Mendelson (ANU collaborator), who ranks Lecué above other prominent young statisticians including Richard Nickl (Cambridge), Alexander Rakhlin (Penn), Philippe Rigollet (MIT), and Holger Rauhut (Aachen). Mendelson emphasizes Lecué's unique role as a "middle link" bridging theoretical and applied statistics. The application includes six reference letters from world-leading statisticians and a comprehensive collection of 22 research articles spanning his key research areas.
