# Sen, Sanchayan

## Overview

Application materials for Sanchayan Sen, a postdoctoral fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology applying for the ANU 2016 continuing lecturer/senior lecturer/associate professor position in Mathematical Science. Sen completed his PhD in Mathematics at NYU Courant Institute (2010-2014) under Sourav Chatterjee, specializing in probability theory with focus on random graphs, random trees, complex networks, scaling limits, stochastic geometry, and random matrices. The application includes CV, cover letter, research and teaching statements, five strong reference letters from prominent probabilists (Bhamidi, Chatterjee, Nardi, Spencer, van der Hofstad), and seven research articles demonstrating expertise in critical random graph theory and universality phenomena.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Application-Dr Sanchayan Sen.pdf | Formal application cover letter and selection criteria statement addressing ANU position requirements including PhD qualification, research contributions, teaching experience, funding willingness, and EO commitment |
| CV - Sanchayan Sen.pdf | Comprehensive curriculum vitae showing PhD from Courant Institute (2014), postdoc at TU Eindhoven (2014-present), 11 publications/preprints on random graphs and probability theory, teaching experience, awards (MacCracken fellowship, ISI gold medals), and research talks at major conferences |
| Sen, Sanchayan (Bhamidi).pdf | Strong reference letter from Shankar Bhamidi (UNC Chapel Hill) describing Sen as "technically and creatively easily one of the strongest young probabilists" with major contributions to three highly technical papers (99+ pages) on critical random graph scaling limits and universality classes |
| Sen, Sanchayan (Chatterjee).pdf | Reference letter from PhD advisor Sourav Chatterjee (Stanford) highlighting Sen's "remarkable technical strength, capacity for hard work, and motivation" including solving Kesten-Lee's 1996 open question on minimal spanning trees and completing nearly 200 pages of random graph theory in one year |
| Sen, Sanchayan (Nardi).pdf | Teaching reference from Francesca Nardi (TU Eindhoven) describing Sen's voluntary teaching contributions to pre-master statistics (2DL07) and advanced elective (2WS60) courses, with student evaluation average of 3.8/5.0 for teaching assistant performance |
| Sen, Sanchayan (Spencer).pdf | Reference from Joel Spencer (NYU Courant) focusing on Sen's solution to barely subcritical Bohman-Frieze process problem, demonstrating mastery of continuum branching processes and establishing universality class membership for bounded size rules |
| Sen, Sanchayan (van der Hofstad).pdf | Reference from postdoc mentor Remco van der Hofstad (TU Eindhoven) detailing collaborative work on critical inhomogeneous random graphs, metric convergence, and novel universality classes outside Erdős-Rényi regime, predicting Sen will "grow into one of the leaders in the field" |
