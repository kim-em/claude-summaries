## Overview

This folder contains 13 research articles by Francis K.C. Hui, representing his publication record as part of his 2016 application for a continuing lecturer position at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute. The articles span his research interests in ecological statistics, mixture models, species distribution modeling, and multivariate abundance data analysis, published in high-quality statistical and ecological journals including Trends in Ecology & Evolution, Ecology, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, and Biometrika.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| So Many Variables- Joint Modeling in Community Ecology.pdf | Review article in Trends in Ecology & Evolution (2015) on joint modeling approaches for multivariate ecological data using latent variable models and mixture models, with applications to species distributions and environmental responses |
