# Hui, Francis

## Overview

Application materials for Francis K.C. Hui, a postdoctoral fellow at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute applying for a continuing lecturer position in 2016. Hui completed his PhD in Statistics at UNSW (2012-2014) focusing on finite mixture modeling for multi-species ecological data. His application includes a strong publication record (14+ papers with h-index 5, including a highly-cited Ecology paper with 491 citations), extensive awards (University Medal in Statistics, multiple scholarships), and research specializing in analyzing correlated data, mixed models, and multivariate abundance data in ecology. The folder contains his application letter, CV, four reference letters, and a collection of his research articles.
