## Overview

Collection of 5 peer-reviewed research publications by Garth Tarr demonstrating expertise in robust statistics, quantile regression, and computational methods. The papers span methodological development (robust scale estimators, precision matrix estimation), theoretical contributions (asymptotic theory for long range dependence), and practical applications (confidence interval construction for small samples). This body of work showcases Tarr's strengths in combining theoretical statistics with computational implementation, particularly his focus on robustness to outliers and contamination. All papers were published or in press by 2016, supporting his application for a continuing position at ANU.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Tarr, Garth - 2012 (robust scale estimator based on pairwise means).pdf | Journal of Nonparametric Statistics (2012) article proposing the Pn estimator - an interquartile range of pairwise means - as a robust scale estimator with 86% asymptotic efficiency at the normal distribution and 13.4% breakdown value; includes extensive simulation studies comparing performance to other robust scale estimators |
| Tarr, Garth - 2015 (quantile based estimation of scale and dependence - thesis abstract).pdf | Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society (2015) abstract of Tarr's 173-page PhD thesis (University of Sydney, 2014) supervised by N.C. Weber and S. Müller; summarizes research on quantile regression confidence intervals, robust scale estimation via symmetric quantiles, and applications to long range dependent time series |
| Tarr, Garth - 2016 (robust estimation of precision matrices under cellwise contamination).pdf | Computational Statistics & Data Analysis (2016) article developing methods for precision matrix estimation robust to cellwise contamination in high-dimensional data; combines pairwise covariance estimation with regularization techniques (GLASSO, QUIC, CLIME) and nearest positive definite projection to handle scattered outliers rather than casewise contamination |
| Tarr, Garth - 2012 (small sample performance of quantile regression confidence intervals).pdf | Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation (2012) simulation study evaluating percentile bootstrap (pbs) methods for constructing confidence intervals in quantile regression with small samples (n ≤ 200); tests performance under heavy-tailed errors, skewed covariates, and heteroskedastic models, recommending pbs for its computational simplicity and good finite-sample coverage |
| Tarr, Garth - 2015 (difference of symmetric quantiles under LRD).pdf | Statistics and Probability Letters (2015) theoretical paper establishing asymptotic distributions for τ-quantile range and interquartile range under long range dependent Gaussian processes; proves different limiting behavior depending on Hurst parameter D, with non-Gaussian limits (involving Hermite polynomials and Rosenblatt processes) when D ∈ (1/2, 1) |
