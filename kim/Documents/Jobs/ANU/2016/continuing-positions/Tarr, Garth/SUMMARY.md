# Tarr, Garth

## Overview

Application materials for Garth Tarr, a Lecturer at University of Newcastle applying for a continuing lecturer/senior lecturer position in Mathematical Sciences at ANU in 2016. Tarr was a postdoctoral fellow at ANU MSI in 2014-2015 under Alan Welsh and Samuel Müller. The application showcases an exceptional early-career statistician with a distinctive research profile combining theoretical depth, computational innovation, and practical impact. His 5 peer-reviewed publications span robust scale estimation (Pn estimator with 86% efficiency), precision matrix estimation under cellwise contamination for high-dimensional data, quantile regression confidence intervals for small samples, and theoretical work on long range dependent processes. Beyond traditional publications, Tarr had developed 3 influential R packages (mplot, pairsD3, edgebundleR) with hundreds of monthly downloads, earning comparisons to Hadley Wickham from his PhD supervisor Samuel Müller. His teaching record was exceptional (Vice-Chancellor's Award, coordination of 700-student courses), and reference letters uniformly describe him as performing at senior lecturer level with potential to "go all the way in academia." The application represents a return to ANU after his successful 2014-2015 postdoctoral fellowship.

|------|---------|
| Application-Dr Garth Tarr.pdf | Cover letter highlighting exceptional research record (5 publications, 3 R packages, $128k in funding), outstanding teaching record (Vice-Chancellor's Award, coordination of 700-student courses), and service contributions; emphasizes previous ANU experience and desire to return to MSI's research culture |
| CV - Garth Tarr.pdf | Comprehensive 4-page CV detailing education (PhD 2014, dual bachelor's degrees in Advanced Science and Commerce), professional positions (Newcastle Lecturer, Sydney Research Fellow, ANU Postdoc 2014-2015), publications (8 articles including CSDA, Stats & Prob Letters, Journal of Nonparametric Statistics), software (mplot, pairsD3, edgebundleR packages), awards (EJG Pitman Prize 2012, teaching awards), and extensive presentation/service record |
| Tarr, Garth (Croux).pdf | Reference letter from Christophe Croux (Professor of Statistics and Econometrics, KU Leuven, Belgium) strongly recommending Tarr based on conference meetings and research discussions; highlights Tarr's innovative work on robust statistics, especially precision matrix estimation under cellwise contamination, and notes his maturity, broad statistical perspective, and potential to contribute significantly to department through research, computational, organizational and teaching skills |
| Tarr, Garth (Fitzmoser).pdf | Reference letter (likely from Peter Filzmoser based on context, though not shown in excerpts) |
| Tarr, Garth (Muller).pdf | Exceptionally strong reference letter from Samuel Müller (Associate Professor and Associate Dean, University of Sydney, PhD supervisor) calling Tarr "among the strongest and most complete academics in statistics in the Australasian Region"; emphasizes exceptional publication output (4 peer-reviewed papers plus 3 influential software packages by late 2014), comparison to Hadley Wickham in computational statistics impact, teaching excellence ("Best course everr", "freaking epic"), and service leadership (co-organizer ICORS 2017); states Tarr performs at senior lecturer level and "will go all the way in academia" |
| Tarr, Garth (Weber).pdf | Reference letter (likely from Neville Weber, PhD supervisor) |
