# Ghosh, Subhroshekhar

## Overview

Application materials for Subhroshekhar Ghosh, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University applying for a continuing position at ANU in 2016. Ghosh received his PhD from UC Berkeley in 2013 under Yuval Peres and was working as a postdoc in the Department of ORFE at Princeton with Ramon van Handel at the time of application. His research focuses on probability theory, particularly point processes, determinantal processes, Gaussian zeros, and random polynomials. The folder contains his CV and seven reference letters from prominent mathematicians.
