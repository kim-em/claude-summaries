## Overview

Faculty continuing position selection committee materials for a female-only lecturer/senior lecturer/associate professor position in Mathematical Science at ANU in 2016. Contains applications and reference letters for approximately 50 candidates tracked in a spreadsheet, with individual folders for candidates advanced to later stages. Candidates are categorized into "yes" (7 strong candidates), "maybe" (18 intermediate candidates), and "no" (remainder) folders. Individual candidate folders for those requiring more detailed review include complete applications, CVs, reference letters, and research papers.
