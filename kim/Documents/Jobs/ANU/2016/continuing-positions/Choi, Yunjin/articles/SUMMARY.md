## Overview

Research papers by Yunjin Choi submitted as part of her ANU application. Contains two working papers on statistical methodology: one investigating methods for handling missing data in penalized regression (arXiv preprint), and the other on selecting the number of principal components in PCA using exact hypothesis testing frameworks (revise and resubmit at Annals of Statistics). Both papers were co-authored with advisor Robert Tibshirani, demonstrating Choi's research focus on penalized regression, missing data methods, and selective inference.

| An Investigation of Methods for Handling Missing Data with Penalized Regression.pdf | 14-page arXiv preprint (arXiv:1310.2076v1) co-authored with Tibshirani; introduces non-negative definite covariance approach for estimating parameters in penalized regression with missing observations, compares to mean imputation via simulations |
| Selecting the number of principal components: estimation of the true rank of a noisy matrix.pdf | Research paper (revise and resubmit at Annals of Statistics) developing exact methods for testing significance of principal components using selective inference framework and Kac-Rice formula; represents Choi's dissertation work on rank selection in dimension reduction |
