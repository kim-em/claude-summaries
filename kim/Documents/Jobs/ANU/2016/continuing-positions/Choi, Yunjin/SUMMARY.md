# Choi, Yunjin

## Overview

Application materials for Yunjin Choi, a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Stanford University (expected graduation June 2016) applying for a lecturer position in Mathematical Science at ANU. Choi's research focuses on multivariate data analysis, high-dimensional statistics, and selective inference, particularly developing exact methods for testing the significance of principal components in PCA. Supervised by prominent statisticians Robert Tibshirani and Jonathan Taylor, her dissertation work represents the first sequential testing procedure for the rank of a Gaussian matrix with exact Type I error control. The folder includes her complete application package with four reference letters from distinguished Stanford faculty.
