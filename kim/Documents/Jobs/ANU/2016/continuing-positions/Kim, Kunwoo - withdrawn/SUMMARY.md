# Kim, Kunwoo - withdrawn

## Overview

Application materials for Kunwoo Kim who applied for the ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science but withdrew from consideration. Kim was a postdoctoral fellow at MSRI and the Technion (starting January 2016) with a PhD from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2012) under advisor Richard Sowers. His research focused on stochastic analysis and probability, particularly stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), numerical analysis of SPDEs, and random fractals. The application includes a formal cover letter, CV with extensive publication record in stochastic PDEs, and four reference letters from distinguished mathematicians.
