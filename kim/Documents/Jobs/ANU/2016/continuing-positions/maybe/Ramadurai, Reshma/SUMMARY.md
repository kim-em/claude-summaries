# Ramadurai, Reshma

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Reshma Ramadurai, a postdoctoral fellow from University of Waikato applying for a continuing lecturer position at ANU Mathematical Sciences Institute in 2016. Ramadurai's research focuses on discrete mathematics and combinatorics, with particular expertise in extremal combinatorics, Ramsey theory, and graph theory. Her submitted publications demonstrate strong work on Folkman numbers (both vertex and edge colorings), graph colorings avoiding short odd cycles, and algorithmic graph theory with connections to monadic second-order logic. The folder contains her complete application package including CV, cover letter, selection criteria responses, research vision, teaching philosophy, reference letters from her doctoral supervisor (Andrzej Dudek, Carnegie Mellon/Western Michigan) and postdoc supervisor (Catherine Greenhill, UNSW), plus four peer-reviewed publications from 2011-2012 featuring collaborations with prominent researchers including Vojtěch Rödl and Jaroslav Nešetřil.
