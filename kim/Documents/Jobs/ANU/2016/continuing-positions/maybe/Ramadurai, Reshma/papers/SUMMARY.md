# papers

## Overview

Collection of four research papers by Dr. Reshma Ramadurai submitted as part of her 2016 ANU faculty application. The papers focus on extremal combinatorics, Ramsey theory, and graph theory, particularly exploring Folkman numbers (both vertex and edge colorings), graph colorings avoiding short odd cycles, and algorithmic graph theory with connections to monadic second-order logic. All papers were published between 2011-2012 in peer-reviewed mathematics and computer science journals, with collaborators including Andrzej Dudek (her PhD supervisor at Carnegie Mellon), Vojtěch Rödl, and researchers from Charles University and Masaryk University.
