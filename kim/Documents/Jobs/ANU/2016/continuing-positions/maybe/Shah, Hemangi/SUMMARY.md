# Shah, Hemangi

## Overview

Application materials for Hemangi Shah, a Reader (equivalent to Associate Professor) in Mathematics at Harish-Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad, India, applying for a Senior Lecturer position in Mathematical Science at ANU in 2016. Shah is a differential geometer specializing in harmonic manifolds, asymptotically harmonic manifolds, and Cheeger-Colding theory, with additional work in metric Diophantine approximation. Her application includes a comprehensive CV, detailed research and teaching statements, and strong reference letters from Christopher Connell (Indiana University) and François Ledrappier (University of Notre Dame).
