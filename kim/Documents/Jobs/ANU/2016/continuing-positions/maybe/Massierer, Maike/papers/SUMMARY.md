## Overview

Two peer-reviewed research papers by Maike Massierer demonstrating her expertise in computational number theory, algebraic geometry, and cryptographic applications. Both papers showcase sophisticated mathematical techniques with practical implications for cryptographic systems. The first paper (2015, with Elisa Gorla) addresses point compression for trace zero subgroups using Semaev summation polynomials. The second paper (2016, with Florian Hess) provides an algebraic proof of class field theory for global function fields with constructive, algorithmic methods.
