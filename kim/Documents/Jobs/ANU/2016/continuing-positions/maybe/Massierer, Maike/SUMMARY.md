# Massierer, Maike

## Overview

Application materials for Maike Massierer, a candidate in the 2016 ANU Mathematical Sciences Institute continuing position search. Dr. Massierer was a German mathematician specializing in computational number theory, algebraic geometry, and cryptography. At the time of application (October 2016), she was a research associate at UNSW working with David Harvey, holding a 457 visa requiring sponsorship. Her research focused on point counting algorithms, complex multiplication, discrete logarithm problems, and elliptic/hyperelliptic curve cryptography.
