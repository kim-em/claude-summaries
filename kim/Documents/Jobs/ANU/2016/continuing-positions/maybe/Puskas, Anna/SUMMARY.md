# Puskas, Anna

## Overview

Application materials for Anna Puskás, a postdoctoral fellow at University of Alberta applying for two ANU Mathematical Sciences positions in 2016 (job nos. 511070 and 511069). Puskás completed her PhD at Columbia University in May 2014 under Gautam Chinta and Dorian Goldfeld, working on metaplectic Whittaker functions, Demazure-Lusztig operators, and representation theory with connections to number theory and algebraic combinatorics. The folder contains her comprehensive job application including CV, research and teaching statements, cover letter, and six reference letters from prominent mathematicians.
