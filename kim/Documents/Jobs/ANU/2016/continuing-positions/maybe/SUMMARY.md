## Overview

Application materials for 18 candidates categorized as intermediate strength ("maybe" tier) in the 2016 ANU Mathematical Science continuing position search for a female-only lecturer/senior lecturer/associate professor position. This cohort represents the middle tier of applicants who advanced beyond initial screening but were ranked below the top 7 "yes" candidates and above those placed in the "no" category. The candidate pool demonstrates remarkable diversity across mathematical subdisciplines, career stages, and geographic origins. Research areas span pure mathematics (topology, geometry, algebraic combinatorics, number theory), applied mathematics (probability, PDEs, computational topology), and mathematical physics (string theory, integrable systems). Career stages range from advanced PhD students (Nur Saglam) and fresh postdocs (Holcomb, Lindsey, Ray, Zhu) to established researchers including department chairs (Saez), permanent faculty (Shah), and one internal ANU candidate with an ARC Future Fellowship (Robins). Several candidates required visa sponsorship (Massierer with 457 visa, Nur Saglam without Australian work rights). The applications collectively showcase strong reference letters from distinguished mathematicians, research statements detailing technical expertise, teaching philosophies, and selected publications demonstrating scholarly impact. Notable that one candidate (Neusser) held Austria's highest academic honor (*promotio sub auspiciis praesidentis*) and was a former ANU postdoc returning to apply for a permanent position.
