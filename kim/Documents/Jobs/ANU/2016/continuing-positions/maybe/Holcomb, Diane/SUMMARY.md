# Holcomb, Diane

## Overview

Application materials for Diane Holcomb, candidate for the 2016 ANU Mathematical Sciences continuing position (female only). Dr. Holcomb was a Richard Pierce Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Arizona applying for Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor positions. The folder contains her complete application package including CV, cover letter, research and teaching statement, plus four reference letters from her PhD advisor (Benedek Valkó, UW-Madison), collaborators (Brian Rider, Temple), and teaching evaluator (Bruce Bayly) and mentor (Nicholas Ercolani) at Arizona.
