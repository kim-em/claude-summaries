# Lierl, Janna

## Overview

Application materials for Janna Lierl, a candidate for the 2016 ANU Mathematical Science continuing position search. Dr. Lierl completed her Ph.D. in 2012 at Cornell University (advised by L. Saloff-Coste) and held postdoctoral positions at Bonn and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign before becoming an Assistant Professor at University of Connecticut. Her research focuses on stochastic analysis, particularly Harnack inequalities, heat kernels, boundary Harnack principles, and parabolic inequalities on metric measure spaces and fractals.
