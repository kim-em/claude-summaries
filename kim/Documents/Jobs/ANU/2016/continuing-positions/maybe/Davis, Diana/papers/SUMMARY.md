## Overview

Two research publications by Diana Davis showcasing her work in billiards and flat surfaces. The first is a German-language expository article on billiards and flat surfaces published in 2015, and the second is a research paper on cutting sequences and regular polygons published in Geometriae Dedicata in 2013. Both papers demonstrate Davis's expertise in dynamical systems and geometric methods, particularly her work extending Smillie and Ulcigrai's results on the regular octagon to general regular polygons.
