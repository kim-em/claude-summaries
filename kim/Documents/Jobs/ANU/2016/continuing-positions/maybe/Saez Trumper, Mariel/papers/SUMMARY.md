## Overview

Collection of 10 research publications by Mariel Sáez (Trumper) spanning 2001-2015, focusing on geometric flows, partial differential equations, and geometric analysis. The papers demonstrate her trajectory from PhD work (2008-2009) on curve shortening flow and the parabolic Ginzburg-Landau equation to subsequent work on mean curvature flow, fractional operators, and related topics. Major themes include relaxation methods for geometric flows via phase-field equations, extinction profiles, regularity theory, and applications to hyperbolic geometry and network flows.
