# Saez Trumper, Mariel

## Overview

Application materials for Mariel Saez-Trumper, Professor and department chair at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, applying for the 2016 ANU senior lecturer position. Saez is a Stanford PhD graduate working in partial differential equations and geometric analysis, specifically on curve-shortening flow, mean curvature flow, and nonlocal equations. Her advisor Rafe Mazzeo provides a very strong letter describing her as "very original and talented" with work on network flow singularities and branching into nonlocal equations and higher rank symmetric spaces.
