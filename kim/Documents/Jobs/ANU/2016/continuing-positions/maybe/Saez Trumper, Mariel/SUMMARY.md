# Saez Trumper, Mariel

## Overview

Application materials for Mariel Saez-Trumper, Professor and department chair at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, applying for the 2016 ANU senior lecturer position. Saez is a Stanford PhD graduate (2007) working in partial differential equations and geometric analysis, with a research program spanning curve-shortening flow, mean curvature flow, fractional operators, and nonlocal equations. Her 10 publications (2001-2015) demonstrate progression from PhD thesis work on relaxation methods connecting geometric flows to phase-field equations, through classification of network flow singularities, to recent work on fractional Laplacians on hyperbolic spaces and noncompact manifolds. Her advisor Rafe Mazzeo provides a very strong letter describing her as "very original and talented," highlighting her collaborations with del Pino, González, Schnürer, and others.
