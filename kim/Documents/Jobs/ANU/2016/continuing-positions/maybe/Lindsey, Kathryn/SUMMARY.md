# Lindsey, Kathryn

## Overview

Application materials for Kathryn A. Lindsey, a Dickson Instructor and NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Chicago, applying for a Lecturer position in Mathematical Sciences at the Australian National University in 2016. Lindsey's research focuses on dynamical systems, low-dimensional geometry, and complex analysis, particularly in complex dynamics and flat surfaces (Teichmüller dynamics). The application includes a comprehensive CV, cover letter, research statement, and teaching statement, along with two published research papers on translation surfaces and Julia sets.
