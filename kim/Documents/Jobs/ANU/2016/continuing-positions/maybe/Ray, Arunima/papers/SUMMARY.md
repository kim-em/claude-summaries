## Overview

Two research papers by Arunima Ray demonstrating her work in low-dimensional topology and knot concordance theory. Both papers appeared in *Algebraic & Geometric Topology* in 2015-2016, showcasing her contributions to understanding Casson towers, knot concordance filtrations, and satellite operators.

| Casson towers and filtrations of the smooth knot concordance group - Arunima Ray - Algebr. Geom. Topol. 15 (2015), no. 2, 1119–1159 - MR3342687.pdf | Ray's sole-authored paper (42 pages, 538KB) establishing relationships between Casson towers and the n-solvable, positive, and negative filtrations of the knot concordance group, showing that knots bounding Casson towers of height n+2 are n-solvable and lie in appropriate filtration levels |
| Satellite operators as group actions on knot concordance - Christopher W. Davis and Arunima Ray - Algebr. Geom. Topol. 16 (2016), no. 2, 945–969 - MR3493412.pdf | Joint paper with Christopher W. Davis (26 pages, 405KB) showing that patterns form a submonoid of homology cylinders and proving that patterns with strong winding number ±1 induce injective satellite operators on topological and exotic concordance classes |
