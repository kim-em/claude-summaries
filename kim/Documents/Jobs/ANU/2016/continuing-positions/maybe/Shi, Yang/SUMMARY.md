# Shi, Yang

## Overview

Application materials for Yang Shi, a postdoctoral researcher from the University of Sydney applying for a 2016 ANU Mathematical Sciences continuing position (Lecturer Level B, female only, position 511070). Yang Shi specializes in integrable systems, discrete Painlevé equations, and combinatorial geometry. Her application demonstrates breakthrough research establishing geometric connections between discrete integrable systems and strong teaching experience including large first-year courses.
