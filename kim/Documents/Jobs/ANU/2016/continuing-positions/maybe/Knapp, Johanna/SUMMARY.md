# Knapp, Johanna

## Overview

Complete application dossier for Dr. Johanna Knapp, an Austrian theoretical physicist applying for a Senior Lecturer position in Mathematical Sciences at ANU in 2016. Categorized as intermediate strength ("maybe") among 18 candidates in this tier. Dr. Knapp was at the time a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor at TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology), with research expertise in string theory, Calabi-Yau spaces, D-branes, and physical mathematics. The application includes a complete ANU application form, four strong reference letters from distinguished physicists and mathematicians at CERN, Virginia Tech, University of Vienna, and TU Wien, plus a skipped folder of research papers spanning her work on F-theory, mirror symmetry, and matrix factorizations.
