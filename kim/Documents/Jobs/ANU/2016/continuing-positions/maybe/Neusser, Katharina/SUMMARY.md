# Neusser, Katharina

## Overview

Application materials for Katharina Neusser, candidate for a 2016 ANU Mathematical Sciences continuing position (Lecturer Level B, Job No. 511070). Neusser is an Austrian differential geometer specializing in parabolic geometries, who was a postdoctoral fellow at ANU MSI from 2010-2015. The folder contains her complete application package including CV, research and teaching statements, selection criteria responses, cover letter, and four reference letters from distinguished collaborators (Cap, Calderbank, Eastwood, and Gover), plus two research papers.
