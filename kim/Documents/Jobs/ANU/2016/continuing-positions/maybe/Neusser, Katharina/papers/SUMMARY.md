# papers

## Overview

This folder contains two research publications by Katharina Neusser in differential geometry. Both papers focus on parabolic geometries and geometric structures on manifolds. The first paper (2009, co-authored with Andreas Čap) investigates automorphism groups of generic distributions using the theory of Cartan connections. The second paper (2012, sole author) develops a general prolongation method for overdetermined systems of partial differential equations on regular infinitesimal flag manifolds, generalizing earlier work on almost hermitian symmetric structures.
