# Portal, Pierre

## Overview

Application materials for Pierre Portal, a candidate for a female-only continuing lecturer/senior lecturer/associate professor position at ANU MSI in 2016. Portal was an ARC Future Fellow (2014-2019) and Senior Lecturer at ANU applying to convert his fixed-term position to a permanent role. The package includes his application letter, CV, claims against selection criteria, research and teaching statements, four strong reference letters, and a subdirectory containing 11 research articles demonstrating his expertise in harmonic and stochastic analysis.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Application-Dr Pierre Portal.pdf | 16-page application package including cover letter dated December 8, 2015, CV (6 pages showing PhD 2004 from Missouri-Columbia and Université de Franche-Comté, positions held, 15 publications, 2 preprints, grants totaling over $1.3M AUD including ARC Future Fellowship), claims against 7 selection criteria, and detailed research statement (6 pages on harmonic/stochastic analysis, tent spaces, Gaussian Hardy spaces, functional calculus of Dirac operators) and teaching statement (demonstrating excellence with 96% and 93% student agreement rates, innovations in technology and pedagogy) |
| CV - Pierre Portal.pdf | 6-page curriculum vitae showing: PhD 2004 (joint Missouri-Columbia/Université de Franche-Comté under Nigel Kalton and Gilles Lancien), current position as ARC Future Fellow (0.8 FTE) and Senior Lecturer (Level C, promoted 2015), 15 published articles in top journals (Journal of Functional Analysis, Mathematische Annalen, Revista Matematica Iberoamericana), 2 submitted preprints, 3 major ARC grants ($445K DP 2016-2018, $575K Future Fellowship 2014-2019, $320K DP 2012-2015), extensive editorial and organizational work (editor Complex Analysis and Operator Theory since 2014, organizer IWOTA 2012 Sydney), PhD supervision (Alexander Amenta, joint with Paris 11-Orsay, expected completion Feb 2016; Julian Bayley since July 2015), postdoc supervision (Dorothee Frey 2012-2014, now lecturer at TU Delft), teaching at undergraduate and graduate levels with strong student evaluations and nomination for ANU "Last Lecture" 2013-2014 |
| Portal, Pierre (Auscher).pdf | 4-page reference letter from Pascal Auscher (Professeur de Mathématiques, Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, dated January 8, 2016) providing exceptionally strong support for Portal's application, highlighting: research achievements including breakthrough work on non-autonomous parabolic problems (70-page paper with Auscher and Monniaux described as "my most ambitious project to date"), innovative stochastic PDE work using tent spaces beating Krylov's limits, first successful Gaussian Hardy space definition, publications in top journals (JFA, Math. Annalen, Revista Mat. Iberoamericana, Advances in Math), quality over quantity approach with 14 long substantial papers, successful PhD supervision (Alex Amenta, supervised first half independently, now close to submission), describes Portal as "way above level C and close to level D" for research supervision capability, exceptional teaching with 96% and 93% agreement rates (ANU target is 80% on 65% of classes by 2020), extensive service contributions (lead organizer IWOTA Sydney 2012, hiring committees, MSI IT committee and review), concludes Portal "is now an ARC Future fellow" and "would make an excellent choice by hiring him more permanently" |
| Portal, Pierre (Ferrario).pdf | 2-page reference letter from Prof. Lilia Ferrario (Associate Director Education, MSI, ANU, dated January 7, 2016) focusing on Portal's teaching excellence and educational contributions, noting: one research area is Stochastic Analysis (matching position requirements), exceptional teaching achievements including transformation of problematic MATH1116 course (130-150 students) from low satisfaction to high success through innovative pedagogical approaches, strong student engagement and willingness to modify teaching based on feedback, active participation in Centre for Higher Education Learning and Teaching (CHELT) workshops and teaching discussions, innovative use of technology including Digital Lecture Delivery system and video recording despite ANU lecture theatre limitations, collaboration on GPS mathematics film project (2012 ANU teaching enhancement grant with Dr Judy-Ann Osborne), extensive service on committees including MSI IT committee and review panel ("in need of some radical shake-up"), concludes "Pierre would be a great asset to the MSI" |
| Portal, Pierre (McIntosh).pdf | 1-page reference letter from Professor Alan McIntosh FAA (Professor Emeritus, MSI, ANU, dated December 21, 2015) as a long-time collaborator and mentor (known Portal since 2002), emphasizing: PhD thesis (Besançon and Missouri jointly) showed "considerable insight" on maximal regularity, joint work with Hytönen and McIntosh on Kato square root problem for vector-valued functions required "hard work, considerable insight into stochastic and mathematical analysis, and wide knowledge", recent work with Frey and McIntosh on Hodge-Dirac operators using tent spaces shows "considerable talent and originality", persistence with Gaussian harmonic analysis in collaboration with van Neerven and Maas produced "substantial advances", recent paper with Auscher and Monniaux on non-autonomous parabolic equations is "remarkable" and "ground-breaking" and "probably his best work, and worthy of publication in a top journal", describes Portal as able to "draw on techniques from a number of areas of mathematics and stochastic analysis" with "knowledge of a variety of topics and his ability to inter-relate them", "dedicated and popular teacher and supervisor" with students always around his office, "excellent" organizer of conferences including IWOTA ("several regular participants claiming it was the best they had attended"), "dedicated and enthusiastic researcher who is an asset to our department" |
| Portal, Pierre (van Neerven).pdf | 2-page reference letter from Jan van Neerven (Professor of Stochastic Analysis, Delft University of Technology, dated January 7, 2016) as long-time collaborator providing exceptionally strong support, describing Portal as: "leading expert in at least two areas of research: the theory of tent spaces and their applications to harmonic and stochastic analysis, and the functional calculus for Dirac operators and its applications to deterministic and stochastic PDEs", consistent output of ~2 papers/year with "very high standards" for quality, each paper "end-product of a long process of intense reflection and hard work during many months (and in some cases several years)", addresses "deep mathematical questions" fitting "into a broader vision of where the subject should be going", Gaussian harmonic analysis programme "largely Pierre's" with key H^1 result a "mathematical tour de force which Pierre completed single-handedly", work with Auscher and Monniaux on maximal regularity "highly original" and will "almost certainly...have a big impact in the field" with "substantial and significant" contributions from Portal, "leading figure in introducing tent space techniques and Dirac operator formalism into the field of stochastic analysis", publications in top journals, regular invited speaker internationally with "fine network of collaborations" including "some of the very best researchers internationally (Auscher, Hytönen, Kalton, McIntosh)", ARC Discovery Project and Future Fellowship recognition, "great passion for mathematics" in research talks, excellent teaching evaluations, innovative technological engagement including "very original" teaching films "shot at rather unusual places (e.g. while surfing)", MSc supervision with "some of exceptional quality", first PhD student defending Spring 2016, maintains "very active research environment at ANU", organizer of IWOTA 2012 ("immense and difficult task...made this conference into a great success"), concludes "Pierre qualifies for the position of Senior Lecturer...I do not hesitate to state that Pierre's achievements actually merit a hiring on level D" |
