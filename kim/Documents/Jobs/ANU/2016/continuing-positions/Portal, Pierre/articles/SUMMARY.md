## Overview

Collection of 11 research publications by Pierre Portal demonstrating his expertise in harmonic and stochastic analysis. The papers span 2003-2014 and appear in top mathematics journals including Advances in Mathematics, Journal of Functional Analysis, Journal of Evolution Equations, Revista Matemática Iberoamericana, and Mathematische Zeitschrift. Key research themes include tent spaces and their applications to PDEs, Gaussian Hardy spaces, functional calculus for Hodge-Dirac operators, maximal regularity theory, Kato's square root problem, pseudodifferential operators on Bochner spaces, and vector-valued harmonic analysis. Most papers are co-authored with leading researchers including Tuomas Hytönen, Alan McIntosh, Pascal Auscher, Jan van Neerven, and others, showing Portal's extensive international collaboration network.
