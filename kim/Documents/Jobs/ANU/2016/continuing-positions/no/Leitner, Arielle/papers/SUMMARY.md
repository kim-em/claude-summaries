## Overview

Collection of three published research papers by Arielle Leitner from 2010-2016, demonstrating her research expertise in geometric topology, Lie groups, and combinatorial mathematics. The papers span work from her undergraduate years through her doctoral research at UC Santa Barbara under Daryl Cooper. Topics include: (1) classification of subgroups in SL(4,ℝ) and generalized cusps in projective 3-manifolds (2016, Topology and its Applications), (2) conjugacy limits of diagonal Cartan subgroups in SL₃(ℝ) using nonstandard analysis (2016, Geometriae Dedicata), and (3) universal cycles of restricted word classes (2010, Discrete Mathematics, co-authored with Anant Godbole). This research directly supports her application's emphasis on geometric transitions, Lie group theory, and convex projective structures.
