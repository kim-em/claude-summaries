# Leitner, Arielle

## Overview

Application from Arielle Leitner, a postdoctoral researcher at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science. PhD from UC Santa Barbara (2015) under Daryl Cooper. Research specializes in geometric topology, geometric transitions, Lie groups, and convex projective structures. Particularly focused on limits of the Cartan subgroup in SL(n,R) and applications to generalized cusps on projective manifolds. Required visa sponsorship. Not advanced to final consideration.
