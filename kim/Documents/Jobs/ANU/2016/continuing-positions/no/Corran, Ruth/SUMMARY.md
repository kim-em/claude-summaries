# Corran, Ruth

## Overview

Application materials for Ruth Corran, an Australian mathematician based in Paris, applying for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science. Corran held a PhD from University of Sydney (2000) and was an Associate Professor at the American University of Paris at the time of application. Her application was for Senior Lecturer/Level C based on her research in algebra (reflection groups, braid groups, and related monoids), strong teaching record, and extensive administrative experience.
