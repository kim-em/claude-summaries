## Overview

Collection of five published research papers by Dr. Yeuk-Kwan Edna Cheung submitted as part of her 2016 ANU Associate Professor application. Papers span 2000-2006 and demonstrate expertise in string theory, non-commutative geometry, cosmology, and high-energy physics. All papers are published in top-tier journals (Journal of High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics B) with collaborators from leading institutions including Princeton IAS, UC Berkeley, Perimeter Institute, and McGill.
