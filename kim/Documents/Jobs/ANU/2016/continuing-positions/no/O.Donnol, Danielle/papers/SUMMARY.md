## Overview

Two published research papers by Danielle O'Donnol in knot theory and spatial graph theory. The first paper (Osaka J. Math., 2015) extends work on relationships between knotting and linking in the Petersen family of graphs, proving that complexly algebraically linked spatial graphs in this family must be knotted. The second paper (Pacific J. Math., 2014) is joint work with Elena Pavelescu studying Legendrian θ-graphs in contact topology, characterizing realizability of Thurston-Bennequin and rotation numbers and introducing the transverse push-off.

Math. 270 (2014), no. 1, 191–210 - MR3245854.pdf | 23-page research paper with Elena Pavelescu extending classical invariants (Thurston-Bennequin number and rotation number) from Legendrian knots to Legendrian θ-graphs; proves realizability conditions for unknotted cycles and introduces the transverse push-off of a Legendrian graph |
