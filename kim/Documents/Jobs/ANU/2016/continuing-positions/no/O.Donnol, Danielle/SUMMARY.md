# O.Donnol, Danielle

## Overview

Complete application materials for Danielle O'Donnol, who applied for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science. O'Donnol was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Indiana University with a PhD from UCLA (2008) under advisors Erica Flapan and Robert Brown. Her research focused on knot theory, spatial graph theory, Legendrian graphs, Floer homology, and DNA topology, with published papers extending Nikkuni's work on the Petersen family of spatial graphs and collaborative work with Elena Pavelescu on Legendrian θ-graphs in contact topology. She had an active NSF research grant ($144,577, 2014-2017), extensive teaching experience including as Calculus I Coordinator at Oklahoma State University, and notable laboratory experience in molecular biology from her undergraduate years. The application includes six reference letters from prominent mathematicians including PhD advisor Erica Flapan and collaborators Shelly Harvey and Dorothy Buck. Required visa sponsorship.
