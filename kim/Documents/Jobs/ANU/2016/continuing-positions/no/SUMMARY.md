## Overview

Application materials for 29 candidates not advanced to final consideration in the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position search in Mathematical Science. Each candidate folder contains application materials and reference letters. These candidates were evaluated but determined not to be competitive for the position compared to those in the "yes" and "maybe" categories.
