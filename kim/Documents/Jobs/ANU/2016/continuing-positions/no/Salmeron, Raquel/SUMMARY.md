# Salmeron, Raquel

## Overview

Application from Dr. Raquel Salmeron for a Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor position in Mathematical Science at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute (2016 female-only continuing position). Australian citizen and former ANU staff member (2006-2015), internationally recognized researcher in magnetohydrodynamics and protostellar disk modeling, with PhD in Physics from University of Sydney (2005) and MBA. Strong publication record (190+ citations on MRI work, 144 on jets/outflows), secured over $580k in external funding including ARC Discovery Project as lead CI. After leaving ANU in 2015, worked as Network Performance and Analysis Manager at Airservices Australia while maintaining ANU collaborations. Not advanced to final consideration despite strong teaching record (improved student satisfaction from 3.0 to 4.1 in PHYS2020) and excellent reference letters from Ferrario, Wardle, and Ireland.
