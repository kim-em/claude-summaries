# Saorin Gomez, Eugenia

## Overview

Application materials for Eugenia Saorín Gómez, a highly accomplished Spanish mathematician specializing in convex geometry and Brunn-Minkowski theory who applied for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science. At the time of application (October 2016), she was an assistant researcher at Otto-von-Guericke Universität Magdeburg, Germany, with a PhD from University of Murcia (2008). Her research record includes seven published papers (2010-2015) in top convex geometry journals covering mixed volumes, quermassintegrals, inner parallel bodies, kernel centers, and Bonnesen-style inequalities. References uniformly describe her as among the top 3% of young researchers internationally in her field, highlighting her solutions to 40+ year old open problems and noting her achievements while being a mother of two as "almost superhuman." Despite this exceptionally strong profile, she was not advanced to final consideration for the position. She required visa sponsorship and could start April 1, 2017.
