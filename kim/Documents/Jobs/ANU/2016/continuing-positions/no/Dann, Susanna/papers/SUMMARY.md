## Overview

Two research publications by Susanna Dann on sections of convex bodies and the Busemann-Petty problem, both published in prestigious mathematics journals (Advances in Mathematics and Advances in Applied Mathematics). The first paper, co-authored with Marisa Zymonopoulou, studies how symmetries affect geometric properties of convex bodies and generalizes results for complex and quaternionic convex bodies. The second paper is a solo work investigating the lower dimensional Busemann-Petty problem in complex hyperbolic space, using Fourier transform methods to prove that the answer is affirmative only for sections of complex dimension one.
