# Jhorar, Bablesh

## Overview

Application materials for Bablesh Jhorar, a candidate for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science. Dr. Jhorar was an Assistant Professor at Chaudhary Devilal University (CDLU) Sirsa with a recently completed PhD (thesis submitted May 2016) from Panjab University Chandigarh in algebraic number theory and valuation theory under Prof. Sudesh K. Khanduja. Her research focuses on factorization of polynomials over henselian valued fields, with published work extending Ore's Theorem and Hensel's Lemma. The application included a published paper in Manuscripta Mathematica (2016, co-authored with her supervisor) demonstrating this research, along with strong reference letters from her PhD supervisor and colleagues. The application required visa sponsorship.
