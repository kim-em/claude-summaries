## Overview

Contains a published research paper by Dr. Rishika Rupam and her PhD supervisor Alexei Poltoratski on meromorphic inner functions and restricted interpolation. The paper appeared in Concrete Operators journal in 2016 and surveys recent results on function theoretic properties of Meromorphic Inner Functions (MIFs) and their connections to spectral problems for Schrödinger operators. This work relates to her application materials by demonstrating her research on meromorphic inner functions and complex analysis, which was part of her thesis work correcting an error in de Branges' 1968 book.
