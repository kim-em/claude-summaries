# Rupam, Rishika

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Rishika Rupam, a postdoctoral researcher at Université de Lille 1, for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Sciences. The application was not advanced to final consideration. Dr. Rupam completed her PhD at Texas A&M University in 2015 under the supervision of Alexei Poltoratski, specializing in complex analysis, harmonic analysis, meromorphic inner functions, and spectral problems for differential operators. Her most notable achievement was correcting a key lemma in de Branges' famous 1968 book on Hilbert spaces of entire functions, with a paper accepted in Journal d'Analyse Mathematique. The application includes a published paper demonstrating her research on restricted interpolation by meromorphic inner functions with applications to inverse spectral theory for Schrödinger operators.
