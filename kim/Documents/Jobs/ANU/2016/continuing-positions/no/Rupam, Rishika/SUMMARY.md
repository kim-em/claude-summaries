# Rupam, Rishika

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Rishika Rupam, a postdoctoral researcher at Université de Lille 1, for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Sciences. The application was not advanced to final consideration. Dr. Rupam completed her PhD at Texas A&M University in 2015 under the supervision of Alexei Poltoratski, specializing in complex analysis, harmonic analysis, meromorphic inner functions, and spectral problems for differential operators.
