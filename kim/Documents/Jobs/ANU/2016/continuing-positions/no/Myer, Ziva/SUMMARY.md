# Myer, Ziva

## Overview

Application from Ziva Myer, a PhD candidate at Bryn Mawr College specializing in contact and symplectic geometry with a focus on generating families for Legendrian submanifolds. The application includes her full materials and two strong reference letters from Joshua Sabloff (Haverford College) and Lisa Traynor (her advisor at Bryn Mawr College). Myer was applying for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science but required visa sponsorship and was not advanced to final consideration.
