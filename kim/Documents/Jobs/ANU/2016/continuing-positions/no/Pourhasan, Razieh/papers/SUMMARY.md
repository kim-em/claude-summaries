## Overview

Single research paper by R.B. Mann and R. Pourhasan examining Gauss-Bonnet black holes and their holographic dual description of heavy fermion metals. Published in Journal of High Energy Physics (2011), this 16-page paper investigates non-Fermi-liquid behavior in condensed matter systems using Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Lifshitz boundary conditions. The work proposes that charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes serve as gravitational duals to the Castro-Neto et al. model of f-electron compounds exhibiting anomalous specific heat at low temperatures.
