# Pourhasan, Razieh

## Overview

Application materials for Razieh Pourhasan, a theoretical physicist specializing in holography, black holes, and gauge/gravity duality. PhD from University of Waterloo/Perimeter Institute (2014) with supervisors Robert C. Myers and Robert B. Mann. At time of application, postdoctoral research fellow at University of Iceland (on maternity leave June-November 2016). Notable achievements include 14 publications (2 as graduate student in Iran, 11 more during PhD), high-profile media coverage in Nature News and Scientific American cover article on holographic cosmology, and John Brodie Prize as top PhD graduate from Perimeter Institute 2014.
