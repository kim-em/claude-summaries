# Liao, Xian

## Overview

Application materials from Xian Liao, a postdoctoral researcher in mathematical analysis specializing in partial differential equations and fluid mechanics. At the time of application (September 2016), she was a postdoc at Mathematisches Institut, Bonn, working with Herbert Koch on Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Her research background includes zero Mach number systems, density patch problems for inhomogeneous incompressible fluids, and non-Newtonian fluids. She required visa sponsorship and could start January 1, 2018.
