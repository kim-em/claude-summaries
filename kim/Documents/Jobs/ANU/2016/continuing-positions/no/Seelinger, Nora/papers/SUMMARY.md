## Overview

Research publications by Nora Seeliger demonstrating her expertise in algebraic topology, specifically loop space homology, string topology, and homotopy theory. Contains two papers published in Forum Mathematicum (2012 and 2014) on loop homology computations for spheres, complex projective spaces, and spaces related to Dickson invariants. These publications showcase her work on Chas-Sullivan loop products, spectral sequence methods, and Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras, representing core research contributions supporting her 2016 ANU application.
