# Ginges, Jacinda

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Jacinda S. M. Ginges, an atomic theorist applying for a Lecturer position in Mathematical Science at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute in October 2016. Ginges is an Australian citizen and Senior Research Associate/Lecturer at UNSW specializing in high-precision atomic many-body theory, QED radiative corrections, and tests of fundamental physics. Her application includes a CV showing a 5-year career break (2009-2014) for child-rearing, with publications resuming strongly in 2015-2016, and four reference letters from world-leading physicists.
