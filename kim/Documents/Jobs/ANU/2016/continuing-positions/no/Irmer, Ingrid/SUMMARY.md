# Irmer, Ingrid

## Overview

Application materials from Ingrid Irmer for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science. Irmer is an Australian/German mathematician specializing in low-dimensional topology, mapping class groups, and Lorentzian geometry. At the time of application, she was at the University of Melbourne with extensive postdoctoral experience across Australia, Asia, Europe, and the US. Her PhD (magna cum laude) was from Universität Bonn under Ursula Hamenstädt. The application includes CV, cover letter, research statement, and teaching statement. Her supporting materials include a 2015 publication in Algebraic & Geometric Topology establishing connections between signed stable length on curve graphs and the Chillingworth class, demonstrating her work on the interface of geometric group theory and mapping class groups.
