| The Chillingworth class is a signed stable length - Ingrid Irmer - Algebr. Geom. Topol. 15 (2015), no. 4, 1863–1876 - MR3402331.pdf | Published research paper (14 pages, 297KB) proving that signed stable length on curve graphs equals half the Chillingworth class, a cohomology class dual to a contraction of the Johnson homomorphism; establishes connections between geometric group actions on curve graphs and algebraic topology of the Torelli group for surfaces of genus g ≥ 3; published in Algebraic & Geometric Topology, September 2015 |
