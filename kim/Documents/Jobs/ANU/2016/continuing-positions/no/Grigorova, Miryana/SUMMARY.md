# Grigorova, Miryana

## Overview

Application materials for Miryana Grigorova, a postdoctoral researcher from Germany applying for the 2016 ANU female-only continuing position in Mathematical Science. Grigorova held a PhD from University Paris-Diderot (2013) in applied mathematics, supervised by Marie-Claire Quenez, with research focused on Choquet integration theory, capacities, and applications to risk measurement. At the time of application (October 2016), she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Risk and Insurance in Hanover, having previously held a postdoctoral position at Humboldt University-Berlin (2014-2016). Her research interests spanned probability theory, stochastic analysis, backward stochastic differential equations, optimal stopping, and applications to mathematical finance and actuarial science. Notably, she required visa sponsorship and could not start until September 2017.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| application.pdf | Complete application package (18 pages, 6.7 MB) including application form, CV, cover letter, teaching statement, and research statement. PhD thesis on non-additive integration theory with applications to finance and insurance, achieved with highest honors. Postdoctoral work at Humboldt (2014-2016) with Peter Imkeller on BSDEs and reflected BSDEs, and current position (2016) at Center for Risk and Insurance, Hanover with Stefan Weber on systemic risk |
| Miryana Grigorova_Reference Report by Hans Foellmer.pdf | Strong reference letter (3 pages) from Hans Föllmer at Humboldt University-Berlin, who served as external examiner on her thesis. Praises her innovative approach to second order stochastic dominance using Choquet capacities, opening "a whole new chapter in the theory of monetary risk measures." Commends her clear communication style and predicts success as both researcher and teacher |
| Miryana Grigorova_Reference Report by Marie-Claire Quenez.pdf | Enthusiastic reference letter (2 pages) from PhD supervisor Marie-Claire Quenez at Université Paris-Diderot. Emphasizes Grigorova's autonomy and creativity, noting she chose her own thesis topic and all ideas were hers. Highlights publications in Statistics & Risk Modeling and Comptes Rendus, ongoing work on reflected BSDEs under revision at Annals of Applied Probabilities, and supervision of Master's students. Describes her as "an excellent researcher who is very autonomous" with "great pleasure to work with" |
