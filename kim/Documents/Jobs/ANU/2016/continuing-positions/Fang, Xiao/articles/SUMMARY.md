## Overview

Collection of five published research papers by Xiao Fang demonstrating his research contributions in probability theory and Stein's method. All papers published in top-tier journals (Bernoulli, Annals of Probability, Electronic Communications in Probability) between 2013-2015. Papers showcase Fang's work on multivariate normal approximation, central limit theorems, moderate deviations, and applications to graph theory and combinatorics.
