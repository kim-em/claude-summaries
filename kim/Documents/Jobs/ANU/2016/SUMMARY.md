# 2016

## Overview

Fifth year of ANU faculty employment documenting a pivotal year: promotion to Associate Professor (Level D), substantial administrative service as HDR Convenor for MSI, and an exceptional teaching load spanning four distinct course levels. The teaching portfolio included MATH1014 first-year calculus/linear algebra (~400 students, co-taught with Griffith Ware, with 25 linear algebra lectures and comprehensive examination documentation), MATH3325/6214 Analysis 3 (23 students, covering functional analysis and spectral theory with sophisticated pedagogical materials including essay writing with contract cheating detection), a special topics Category Theory course (6 advanced students producing original final reports on topics from Jones polynomials to model categories), a special topics Representation Theory course (2 students exploring character table computation via Burnside-Dixon-Schneider algorithm), and an Australian Summer Course on Knot Theory (1 student achieving 92% on homological Burau representation, co-supervised with Zsuzsanna Dancso).

The year saw intensive research supervision across levels: PhD student Cain Edie-Michell, five honours students (Benjamin Thompson on Khovanov homology rated 90-93, Tejas Iyer on random tournaments praised as publishable, Florence Verity on Coq vote counting verification, Victor Wang on cluster algebras, Lachlan Maynard on combinatorial knot Floer homology), and summer research supervision. Research achievements included the DP16 grant ($455,992 for fusion categories/modular data) and international collaboration at MATRIX, AIM Square, Casa Matematica Oaxaca, Bonn, and Oberwolfach. Administrative service extended to IT committee work proposing post-publication web editing for MSI, Performance Development Review documenting 60%/30%/10% research/education/service split, and postdoctoral hiring with Anthony Licata. The annual report captures the full scope: promotion, continued leadership in quantum symmetries research, extensive student supervision, and professional service on MathOverflow board and arXiv advisory board.
