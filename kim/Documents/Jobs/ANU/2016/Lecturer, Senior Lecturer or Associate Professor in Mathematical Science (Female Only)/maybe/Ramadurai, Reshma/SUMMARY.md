# Ramadurai, Reshma

## Overview

Application materials for Dr Reshma Ramadurai, a combinatorics researcher applying for a faculty position at ANU. At the time of application (2016), she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. Her PhD from Carnegie Mellon University focused on Ramsey theory and Folkman numbers. Research areas include extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, graph and hypergraph theory, random graphs, and Latin squares. Four strong reference letters from supervisors and colleagues praise her research abilities and teaching skills. She had extensive teaching experience including a 180-student undergraduate course.
