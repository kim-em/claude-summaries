# Ramadurai, Reshma

## Overview

Application materials for Dr Reshma Ramadurai, a combinatorics researcher applying for a faculty position at ANU. At the time of application (2016), she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. Her PhD from Carnegie Mellon University focused on Ramsey theory and Folkman numbers, supervised by Andrzej Dudek. Research areas include extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, graph and hypergraph theory, random graphs, and Latin squares. Her published work demonstrates significant contributions to induced Folkman numbers (proving upper bounds using projective planes), hypergraph Ramsey theory, vertex colorings avoiding short odd cycles, and theoretical computer science (introducing shrub-depth for MSO logic). Four strong reference letters from supervisors and colleagues (Catherine Greenhill at UNSW, Andrzej Dudek, Tim Stokes, and Nick Cavenagh at Waikato) praise her research abilities, collaborative nature, and teaching skills. She had extensive teaching experience including a 180-student undergraduate course.
