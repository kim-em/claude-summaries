## Overview

Research papers by Reshma Ramadurai demonstrating her work in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, Ramsey theory, hypergraph theory, and theoretical computer science. The collection represents four peer-reviewed publications from 2011-2012, co-authored with prominent researchers including Andrzej Dudek, Vojtech Rodl, and Jaroslav Nesetril. Topics range from induced Folkman numbers and vertex colorings to MSO logic on graph classes.

| On induced Folkman numbers - Andrzej Dudek, Reshma Ramadurai, and Vojtech Rodl - Random Structures Algorithms 40 (2012), no. 4, 493-500 - MR2925309.pdf | Proves upper bound F(G,r) <= Cn^3/omega * log^c(n) on induced Folkman numbers as function of graph order n and clique number omega; uses projective planes for random graph construction |
| Some remarks on vertex Folkman numbers for hypergraphs - Andrzej Dudek and Reshma Ramadurai - Discrete Math. 312 (2012), no. 19, 2952-2957 - MR2946956.pdf | Extends vertex Folkman number bounds to k-uniform hypergraphs; shows cn^2 <= max{F(r,G)} <= Cn^2(log n)^2 for k-uniform hypergraphs of order n |
| Vertex colorings of graphs without short odd cycles - Andrzej Dudek and Reshma Ramadurai - J. Graph Theory 68 (2011), no. 3, 255-264 - MR2838336.pdf | Quantitative extension of Nesetril-Rodl result on partitions of vertices; constructs graph H with odd girth g and polynomial order in m such that any r-coloring yields monochromatic induced copy of G |
| When trees grow low shrubs and fast MSO_1 - Robert Ganian, Petr Hlineny, Jaroslav Nesetril, Jan Obdrzalek, Patrice Ossona de Mendez, and Reshma Ramadurai - Mathematical foundations of computer science 2012 419-430 - MR3030450.pdf | Introduces shrub-depth and SC-depth graph invariants; proves MSO1 model checking is FPT with elementary dependence on formula for bounded shrub-depth classes; introduces m-partite cographs |
