# Puskas, Anna

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Anna Puskas, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Alberta applying for the ANU mathematical sciences faculty position. Her research focuses on number theory, specifically p-adic Whittaker functions on metaplectic covers of algebraic groups, with connections to algebraic combinatorics and representation theory. She completed her PhD at Columbia University in 2014 under Gautam Chinta and Dorian Goldfeld. The application includes 6 reference letters from prominent mathematicians and a comprehensive research vision statement detailing multiple research projects on Demazure-Lusztig operators and metaplectic analogues of the Casselman-Shalika formula.
