# Knapp, Johanna

## Overview

Application materials for Johanna Knapp, a mathematical string theorist applying for the ANU mathematical sciences faculty position. At the time of application (October 2016), Knapp was a non-tenure-track assistant professor at Vienna University of Technology, leading the superstring theory working group following the death of her PhD co-supervisor Maximilian Kreuzer. Her work spans mathematical string theory, focusing on Calabi-Yau geometry, mirror symmetry, gauged linear sigma models, F-theory constructions, and matrix factorizations. The folder contains her application, four strongly supportive reference letters, and eight research papers demonstrating expertise at the intersection of algebraic geometry and theoretical physics.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `application.pdf` | Full application package (1.9MB) |
| `Johanna Knapp_Reference Report by Anton Rebhan.pdf` | Letter from current supervisor at Vienna University of Technology; describes her leadership of string theory group, successful habilitation with extremely positive external reviews from Morrison, Pantev, Sharpe, and Walcher; emphasizes teaching excellence and regrets lack of tenure-track opportunities at Vienna |
| `Johanna Knapp_Reference Report by Eric Sharpe.pdf` | Letter from Virginia Tech physicist; discusses her work on gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) and collaboration with Kentaro Hori; compares favorably to other strong candidates like Cyril Closset; notes mathematicians write fewer papers than physicists and anticipates major publication with Hori forthcoming |
| `Johanna Knapp_Reference Report by Ludmil Katzarkov.pdf` | Letter from mathematician at U of Miami/Vienna; highlights computation of normal functions for Calabi-Yau 3-folds yielding Gromov-Witten invariants, work developing homological projective duality with Hori; new project on stability conditions and automorphic forms; strongest possible recommendation |
| `Johanna Knapp_Reference Report by Wolfgang Lerche.pdf` | Letter from PhD supervisor at CERN; describes dissertation work on Landau-Ginzburg models and matrix factorizations for D-brane physics; pioneering paper on open string mirror symmetry for compact Calabi-Yau manifolds; recent major technical paper with Hori on pfaffian Calabi-Yau manifolds using localization techniques; praises mathematical sophistication and work ethic |
