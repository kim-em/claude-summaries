# Zhu, Houying

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Houying Zhu, a candidate for the ANU mathematical sciences position in 2016. Dr. Zhu was a research associate at City University of Hong Kong specializing in quasi-Monte Carlo methods, computational statistics, and numerical analysis. Her application includes a comprehensive CV showing PhD from UNSW (2012-2016, supervised by Josef Dick and Frances Kuo), multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals including work on software reliability modeling, and teaching experience with positive student evaluations. She held a 457 visa requiring sponsorship. The included research paper demonstrates her expertise in computational mathematics through novel software reliability models using compounded-decreased-rate error removal and differential equation methods.
