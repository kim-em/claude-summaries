## Overview

Research publications by Dr. Maike Massierer demonstrating her expertise in computational number theory, algebraic geometry, and cryptography. Contains two peer-reviewed journal articles from her PhD and early postdoctoral work: one on point compression for elliptic curve cryptography (with PhD advisor Elisa Gorla) and one on class field theory for global function fields (with masters advisor Florian Hess). Both papers showcase deep theoretical work with practical cryptographic applications.

Codes Cryptogr. 75 (2015), no. 2, 335–357 - MR3326178.pdf | Develops optimal-size point compression algorithms for trace zero varieties of elliptic curves using Semaev summation polynomials; focuses on cubic and quintic field extensions relevant to pairing-based cryptography |
| Tame class field theory for global function fields - Florian Hess and Maike Massierer - J. Number Theory 162 (2016), 86–115 - MR3448263.pdf | Provides a simplified algebraic proof of class field theory for abelian extensions of degree coprime to the characteristic, using Tate-Lichtenbaum and Ate pairings as tools; relevant to algorithmic number theory |
