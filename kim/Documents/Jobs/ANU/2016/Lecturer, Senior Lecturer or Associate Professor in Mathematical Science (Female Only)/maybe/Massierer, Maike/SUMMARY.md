# Massierer, Maike

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Maike Massierer, a computational number theorist and algebraic geometer specializing in cryptography applications. At the time of application (October 2016), she was a research associate at UNSW working with David Harvey, having previously held a Swiss National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship at LORIA Nancy. Her PhD from University of Basel (2013) focused on trace zero varieties in cryptography. Research interests include point counting on algebraic varieties, constructing curves with complex multiplication, class field theory, and discrete logarithm problem attacks. Strong teaching record with 8 semesters of exercise classes and invited summer school lectures. Four reference letters from David Harvey (UNSW), Elisa Gorla (Neuchatel), Florian Hess (Oldenburg), and Pierrick Gaudry (LORIA). Already held Australian 457 visa requiring sponsorship.
