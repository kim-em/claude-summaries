# Lierl, Janna

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Janna Lierl, a probability/analysis researcher specializing in heat kernel estimates, Harnack inequalities, and Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. At the time of application (October 2016), she was an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the University of Connecticut, having previously held postdoctoral positions at Bonn (Hausdorff Center) and UIUC. She received her PhD from Cornell in 2012 under Laurent Saloff-Coste. The application includes a comprehensive CV, research statement, teaching statement, cover letter, and six reference letters from prominent mathematicians including her PhD advisor, postdoctoral mentors, and leading figures in the field (Martin Barlow FRS). Available to start June 2017.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `application.pdf` | Combined application package including ANU questionnaire, CV (8 pages), cover letter for ANU position (also contains a letter for Christine Mohrmann Fellowship), research statement (8 pages with 34 references), teaching statement (2 pages), and references list |
| `JannaTT16.pdf` | Unknown purpose - possibly a talk abstract or additional document (filename suggests "TT16" may refer to a talk or transcript from 2016) |
| `Letter for Janna Lierl 2016a.pdf` | Reference letter from Karl-Theodor Sturm (Bonn) - describes her as "gifted, highly motivated and hard working mathematician" with worldwide networks; mentions joint work on optimal transport approach to Neumann Laplacians |
| `Janna Lierl_Reference Report by Martin Barlow.pdf` | Reference letter from Martin Barlow FRS (UBC) - praises her work on Boundary Harnack Principle in metric spaces as "a very considerable generalisation of earlier work"; notes she is "working in a technically demanding area, and is doing strong work" |
| `Janna Lierl_Reference Report by Renming Song.pdf` | Reference letter from Renming Song (UIUC mentor) - describes her contributions as "very significant" and states she is "very strong technically and not afraid of tackling difficult problems"; strongly recommends her |
| `Janna Lierl_Reference Report by Scott Ahlgren.pdf` | Teaching reference from Scott Ahlgren (UIUC) - describes classroom observation of her teaching the Central Limit Theorem; notes improving student evaluations (4.1 to 4.5 for upper-level courses); praises her rapport with students |
| `Janna Lierl_Reference Report y Alexander Grigoryan.pdf` | Reference letter from Alexander Grigoryan (Bielefeld) - describes her PHI work as "a very difficult result" requiring mastery of all previously developed methods plus new ideas; calls her "a bright, creative mathematician" |
