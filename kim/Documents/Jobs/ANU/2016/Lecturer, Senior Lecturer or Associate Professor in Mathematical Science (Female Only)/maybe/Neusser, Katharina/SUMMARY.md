# Neusser, Katharina

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Katharina Neusser, an Austrian differential geometer specializing in parabolic geometries and related structures. At the time of application (2016), she was a postdoctoral fellow at Charles University in Prague, having previously held a 5-year postdoc position at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute (2010-2015). Her PhD from the University of Vienna was awarded "sub auspiciis praesidentis" (the highest possible distinction). She has 7 research articles (including a 117-page foundational paper on c-projective geometry submitted to Memoirs of AMS), collaborations with distinguished mathematicians worldwide (Eastwood, Gover, Calderbank, Matveev, Bryant, Melnick), and experience teaching courses from first-year calculus to graduate-level conformal differential geometry.
