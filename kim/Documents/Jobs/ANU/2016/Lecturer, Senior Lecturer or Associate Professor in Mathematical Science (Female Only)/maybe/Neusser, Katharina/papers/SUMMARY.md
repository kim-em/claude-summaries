## Overview

Research papers by Dr. Katharina Neusser demonstrating her work in differential geometry, particularly parabolic geometries and Cartan connections. The collection includes an early collaborative paper with her PhD supervisor Andreas Čap and a substantial solo-authored paper on prolongation methods. Both papers reflect her core expertise in using Cartan-theoretic tools to study geometric structures and overdetermined systems of PDEs.
