# Ray, Arunima

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Arunima Ray, a postdoctoral instructor at Brandeis University specializing in low-dimensional topology, knot theory, and 4-manifolds. PhD from Rice University (2014) under Tim Cochran. Strong publication record with papers in Journal of Topology, Algebraic & Geometric Topology, and PAMS. Research focuses on knot concordance, satellite operators, and the smooth/topological distinction in 4-manifold topology—demonstrated by included papers on Casson tower filtrations (solo author, AGT 2015) and satellite operators as group actions (joint with C.W. Davis, AGT 2016). Has AMS-Simons Travel Grant and teaching experience at undergraduate through graduate levels. Notes personal interest in Australia and research alignment with Dr. Joan Licata at ANU.
