## Overview

Research publications by Dr. Arunima Ray in low-dimensional topology and knot theory. Contains two papers published in Algebraic & Geometric Topology (2015-2016) focusing on knot concordance, Casson towers, and satellite operators. These papers demonstrate expertise in the smooth/topological distinction in 4-manifold topology and connections between geometric constructions and algebraic filtrations of the knot concordance group.

| Casson towers and filtrations of the smooth knot concordance group - Arunima Ray - Algebr. Geom. Topol. 15 (2015), no. 2, 1119-1159 - MR3342687.pdf | Solo-author paper (41 pages) establishing relationships between Casson tower filtrations and the n-solvable/positive/negative filtrations of the smooth knot concordance group. Key results: Theorem A relates Casson tower heights to n-solvability; Theorem B characterizes knots bounding kinky disks in terms of Arf invariant and algebraic self-intersection. |
| Satellite operators as group actions on knot concordance - Christopher W. Davis and Arunima Ray - Algebr. Geom. Topol. 16 (2016), no. 2, 945-969 - MR3493412.pdf | Joint paper with C.W. Davis (25 pages) showing satellite operators can be viewed as group actions via homology cylinders. Proves injectivity of operators with strong winding number ±1 patterns. Constructs bijective (but non-surjective) satellite operators using Mazur-type patterns. |
