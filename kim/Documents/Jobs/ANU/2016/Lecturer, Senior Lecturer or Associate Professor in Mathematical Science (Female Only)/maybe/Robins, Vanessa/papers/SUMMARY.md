## Overview

Three selected research publications by Vanessa Robins showcasing her work in computational topology. The papers span 1998-2004 and represent her core contributions to the field: developing algorithms to compute topological properties (connectedness, disconnectedness) from finite point-set data, extending this theory to handle dynamical systems and fractals, and applying topological methods to periodic minimal surfaces and network structures. All three papers were co-authored with her PhD advisors (Meiss, Bradley) and collaborators (Ramsden, Hyde), demonstrating collaborative research spanning pure mathematics and applications to materials science.
