# Robins, Vanessa

## Overview

Application materials for Dr Vanessa Robins, an ARC Future Fellow in Applied Mathematics at ANU, applying for a Senior Lecturer position at MSI. Her research bridges computational topology and materials science, with foundational contributions to computing topological properties from finite point-set data and applications to periodic minimal surfaces and crystallographic networks. She has a PhD from University of Colorado Boulder (2000) and BSc(Hons) with University Medal from ANU (1994). The folder contains her complete application with cover letter, CV, research/teaching statement, 5 reference letters from prominent mathematicians (Bradley, Edelsbrunner, Meiss, Mischaikow, Hyde), and three selected publications spanning 1998-2004 that showcase her core contributions to computational topology and its applications to dynamical systems and materials science.
