# Robins, Vanessa

## Overview

Application materials for Dr Vanessa Robins, an ARC Future Fellow in Applied Mathematics at ANU, applying for a Senior Lecturer position at MSI. Her research focuses on computational topology (persistent homology, topological data analysis) and topological crystallography (periodic networks, graph embeddings in surfaces). She has a PhD from University of Colorado Boulder (2000) and BSc(Hons) with University Medal from ANU (1994). The folder contains her complete application with cover letter, CV, research/teaching statement, plus 5 reference letters from prominent mathematicians (Bradley, Edelsbrunner, Meiss, Mischaikow, Hyde).
