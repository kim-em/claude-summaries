# Nur Saglam, Kadriye

## Overview

Application materials for Kadriye Nur Saglam, a PhD candidate in mathematics at the University of Minnesota (expected graduation May 2017) under advisor Anar Akhmedov. Her research focuses on low-dimensional topology, symplectic topology, and contact topology, specifically classification problems for smooth and symplectic 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures on small 4-manifolds, and Stein fillings of contact 3-manifolds. She has one published paper in Int. J. Math. (2015) on exotic 4-manifolds via Luttinger surgery on Lefschetz fibrations. Application includes 3 reference letters and extensive teaching experience (9 years across METU and UMN).
