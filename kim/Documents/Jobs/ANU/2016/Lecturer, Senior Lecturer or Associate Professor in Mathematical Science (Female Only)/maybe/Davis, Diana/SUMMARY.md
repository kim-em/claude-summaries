# Davis, Diana

## Overview

Application materials for Diana Davis, a candidate in the "maybe" category for the 2016 ANU mathematical sciences faculty position (female-only). Davis was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Williams College with a Ph.D. from Brown University (2013) under Rich Schwartz. Her research expertise centers on low-dimensional geometry, polygonal billiards, translation surfaces, and dynamical systems, with particular focus on cutting sequences for regular polygons and the Veech group. Her research portfolio includes two publications demonstrating both technical depth (31-page paper in Geometriae Dedicata extending Smillie-Ulcigrai results) and outreach capability (German-language exposition connecting to Mirzakhani's Fields Medal work). The application package includes comprehensive position materials, 5 reference letters from mathematicians including her Ph.D. advisor and current supervisor, and selected research publications.
