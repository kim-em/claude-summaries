## Overview

Research publications by Diana Davis demonstrating her mathematical work in billiards, translation surfaces, and dynamical systems. Contains two peer-reviewed papers from her Ph.D. research period: a popular German-language exposition on billiards and flat surfaces (2015), and a technical paper on cutting sequences and regular polygons published in Geometriae Dedicata (2013). These papers showcase her expertise in low-dimensional geometry, polygonal billiards, and the Veech group—core areas highlighted in her ANU faculty application.

| Billard und ebene Flächen - Diana Davis - Mitt. Dtsch. Math.-Ver. 23 (2015), no. 3, 151–155 - MR3403472.pdf | 5-page German-language expository article on billiards and flat surfaces published in Mitteilungen der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung (2015). Accessible introduction to her research area covering billiard trajectories on polygons, translation surfaces obtained by unfolding, the torus construction, cutting sequences, and connections to Maryam Mirzakhani's Fields Medal work. |
| Cutting sequences, regular polygons, and the Veech group - Diana Davis - Geom. Dedicata 162 (2013), 231–261 - MR3009542.pdf | 31-page technical research paper published in Geometriae Dedicata (2013) extending Smillie-Ulcigrai's octagon results to all regular polygons with odd sides. Characterizes cutting sequences for geodesic flow on double odd-gons using combinatorial derivation, proves the Reassembly Theorem for vertex generator guides, and demonstrates that derivation amounts to keeping sandwiched letters (ksl function) for any double regular n-gon. |
