## Overview

Two published research papers by Yang Shi and collaborators in Journal of Physics A (2014 and 2015) on the mathematical theory of discrete integrable systems. The papers focus on geometric reductions of ABS lattice equations to discrete Painlevé systems, establishing connections between multidimensional integrable quad-equations and lower-dimensional dynamical systems through symmetry group analysis and algebraic geometry.
