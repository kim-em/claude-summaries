# Shi, Yang

## Overview

Application materials for Yang Shi, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Sydney applying for the female-only lecturer position at ANU Mathematical Sciences Institute. Shi is an expert in discrete integrable systems, reflection groups, and discrete Painlevé equations, with a cotutelle PhD from University of Sydney and Paris VI (2010). Her work focuses on establishing connections between ABS lattice equations and Sakai's classification of discrete Painlevé equations through geometric/combinatorial representations of Weyl groups.
