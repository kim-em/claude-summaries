# Shi, Yang

## Overview

Complete application package for Yang Shi, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Sydney applying for the female-only lecturer position at ANU Mathematical Sciences Institute. Shi is an expert in discrete integrable systems, reflection groups, and discrete Painlevé equations, with a cotutelle PhD from University of Sydney and Paris VI (2010). Her research establishes connections between multidimensional ABS lattice equations and discrete Painlevé systems using geometric reduction methods, symmetry group analysis, and algebraic geometry. The application includes comprehensive materials (CV, selection criteria, research/teaching statements), four strong reference letters from international experts including her PhD co-advisors, and two substantial research papers published in Journal of Physics A demonstrating her expertise in geometric reductions of integrable systems.
