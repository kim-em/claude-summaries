## Overview

Research publications by Kathryn A. Lindsey demonstrating her work in dynamical systems, translation surfaces, and ergodic theory. The papers span from her undergraduate REU work (2008) through her graduate research at Cornell (2015), showcasing expertise in both Teichmuller dynamics and measure-theoretic sensitivity - two of the main themes described in her application materials.
