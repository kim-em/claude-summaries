# Lindsey, Kathryn

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Kathryn Lindsey, a Dickson Instructor and NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Chicago (as of 2016). Her research focuses on dynamical systems, low-dimensional geometry/topology, and complex analysis, with two main themes: complex dynamics (particularly polynomial Julia sets and their shapes) and flat surfaces/Teichmüller dynamics. She earned her Ph.D. from Cornell University (2014) under John Smillie and holds multiple prestigious fellowships including NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.
