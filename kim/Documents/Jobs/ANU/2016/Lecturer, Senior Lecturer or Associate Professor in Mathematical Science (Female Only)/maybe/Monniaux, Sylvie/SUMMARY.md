# Monniaux, Sylvie

## Overview

Application materials for Sylvie Monniaux, an assistant professor (maître de conférences) at Université Aix-Marseille since 1998. She specializes in harmonic analysis, functional analysis, and partial differential equations, with expertise in semigroup theory, evolution equations, holomorphic functional calculus, and Navier-Stokes equations in non-smooth domains. PhD from Besançon (1995) under Wolfgang Arendt, habilitation in 2007. Notable for extensive international collaborations (France, Germany, USA, Australia, New Zealand), 28 MathSciNet publications, and an 8-month research visit to ANU in 2014-15. Four reference letters from distinguished mathematicians (Wolfgang Arendt, Thierry Coulhon, Steve Hofmann, and Thierry Gallouet).

The included papers (8 publications spanning 1997-2015) demonstrate her core research themes: bounded imaginary powers of operators, maximal L^p regularity for evolution equations, heat kernels, and Navier-Stokes/Stokes equations in Lipschitz domains. Collaborations with Marius Mitrea, Pascal Auscher, and others produced influential work on singular integrals in tent spaces and the Lame system in non-smooth domains.
