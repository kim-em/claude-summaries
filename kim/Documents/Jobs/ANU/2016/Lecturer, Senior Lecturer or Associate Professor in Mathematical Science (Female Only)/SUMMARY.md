# Lecturer, Senior Lecturer or Associate Professor in Mathematical Science (Female Only)

## Overview

Complete selection committee archive for a female-only continuing faculty position in mathematical sciences at ANU (Job no. 511070) from 2016. Documents a competitive international search with 54 total applicants across pure mathematics, applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and statistics. The collection represents a remarkably thorough evaluation process: 50 candidates tracked in detailed spreadsheet with research areas, PhD pedigree, publication/citation metrics from MathSciNet and Google Scholar, postdoctoral positions, and letter quality assessments. Committee member Scott's notes identify three tiers: top candidates (Wang Qian, Yang, Turner), strong contenders (Neusser, Puskas, Corran, Bapat), and under consideration (9 more). The applicant pool showcased exceptional breadth: from world-class mathematical relativists and geometric analysts with publications in Comm. Pure Appl. Math to topological data analysts, representation theorists, and applied mathematicians in computational imaging. Seven finalists (yes/) included outstanding candidates like Wang Qian (described as "truly remarkable" by Klainerman), Turner (Australian citizen working in applied topology at EPFL), Bourni (geometric analysis expert with 8+ years postdoc), and Yang (geometric representation theory). The 18 "maybe" candidates represented diverse specializations from low-dimensional geometry to number theory, including Robins (already an ARC Future Fellow at ANU) and Neusser (previous 5-year ANU postdoc). Twenty-nine rejected applications, despite often strong credentials, primarily lacked Australian work rights. The archive reveals the challenges of a highly specialized international academic search balanced against visa constraints and research fit.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Summary.csv | Comprehensive spreadsheet of 50 applicants with research areas (algebraic geometry, geometric analysis, topology, number theory, mathematical physics, etc.), PhD details, postdoc positions, Scott's letter quality assessments ("very good", "good", "okay", "weak"), MathSciNet publication/citation counts, and Google Scholar metrics |
| scott-notes.txt | Shortlist of 16 candidates grouped into tiers: top tier (Qian Wang, Yaping Yang, Katharine Turner), strong candidates (Katharina Neusser, Anna Puskas, Ruth Corran, Asilata Bapat), and under consideration (Danielle O'Donnol, Johanna Knapp, Sylvie Monniaux, Eugenia Saorin Gomez, Yang Shi, Raquel Salmeron) |

## Subdirectories

- [x] `maybe/` - 18 mid-tier candidate folders spanning low-dimensional geometry (Davis, Lindsey, Ray, Saez Trumper, Shi), differential geometry (Neusser, Monniaux, Lierl), combinatorics (Ramadurai, Shah), number theory (Massierer, Knapp), topology (Robins - already ARC Future Fellow at ANU), analysis (Holcomb, Puskas), and mathematical physics (Li, Zhu); 13 of 18 include papers subdirectories; Robins and Neusser had strong ANU connections
- [x] `no/` - 29 rejected candidate folders representing highly international pool (mostly lacking Australian work rights) with diverse specializations including number theory, topology, convex geometry, mathematical physics, probability, PDEs, applied mathematics; notable candidates include Salmeron (former ANU employee 2006-2015, Australian citizen), Snow (ANU PhD 2016 in physical oceanography, Australian citizen), Saorin Gomez (solved 40+ year old open problems in convex geometry), and Ginges (theoretical physicist with highly cited Physics Reports review)
- [x] `yes/` - 7 top-tier finalists representing pure mathematics (Bapat in geometric representation theory, Wang Hang in noncommutative geometry, Yang in quantum groups), geometric analysis (Bourni with world-class credentials from Leon Simon/Gerhard Huisken, Wang Qian in mathematical general relativity described as "truly remarkable" by Klainerman), and applied mathematics (Turner in topological data analysis - Australian citizen, Tran in computational imaging); each with 4-6 reference letters from world-leading mathematicians and publications in top-tier journals
