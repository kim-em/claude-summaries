# Wang, Qian

## Overview

Application materials for Qian Wang, a geometric analyst specializing in nonlinear wave equations and mathematical general relativity, applying for the 2016 ANU faculty position. The folder contains a complete application packet (22 pages), four exceptionally strong reference letters from world-leading mathematicians (Igor Rodnianski, Jeremie Szeftel, Mihalis Dafermos, Sergiu Klainerman - her PhD advisor), and three selected research papers demonstrating her groundbreaking work on Einstein vacuum equations. Based on Klainerman's reference, Wang was considered among the very top people in mathematical general relativity and compared favorably to Sijue Wu among women PDE analysts.
