# Tran, Giang

## Overview

Application materials for Giang Tran, an applied mathematician specializing in computational methods, imaging science, and sparse optimization. Tran was a Bing Instructor at UT Austin (2015-present) after completing her PhD at UCLA in 2015 under Stanley Osher. Her research focuses on sparsity-inducing methods in imaging sciences, partial differential equations, data science, and numerical PDE, with applications to brain imaging, chaotic systems recovery, and obstacle problems. Strong reference letters from Stan Osher (UCLA), Rachel Ward (UT Austin), Luminita Vese (UCLA), and Gordan Zitkovic (UT Austin).
