# Turner, Katharine

## Overview

Complete application materials for Dr. Katharine Turner, a postdoctoral scientist at EPFL applying for the 2016 ANU mathematical sciences position. Her application showcases expertise in applied topology, particularly topological data analysis, persistent homology, and statistical shape analysis. Australian citizen with PhD from University of Chicago (advisor: Shmuel Weinberger), available to start September 2017. The application includes four strong reference letters from internationally recognized researchers, a comprehensive 33-page application document covering all selection criteria, and three selected publications demonstrating research excellence. Her published work spans reconstruction theory in Riemannian manifolds, statistical methods for persistence diagrams, and differential geometry of harmonic maps, appearing in top-tier journals (Foundations of Computational Mathematics, Discrete & Computational Geometry, Geometriae Dedicata). The papers subfolder showcases both solo and collaborative research from 2013-2014, establishing her expertise across theoretical foundations and computational applications.
