## Overview

Selected publications demonstrating Dr. Katharine Turner's research excellence in applied topology and topological data analysis. The three papers showcase both solo and collaborative work spanning reconstruction theory, statistical methods for persistence diagrams, and differential geometry. Published in top-tier journals (Foundations of Computational Mathematics, Discrete & Computational Geometry, Geometriae Dedicata) between 2013-2014, these publications establish expertise in persistent homology, statistical shape analysis, and harmonic maps.
