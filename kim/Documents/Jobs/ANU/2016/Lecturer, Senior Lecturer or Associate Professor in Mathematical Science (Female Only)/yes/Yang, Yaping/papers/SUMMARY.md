| Algebraic Elliptic Cohomology Theory and Flops.pdf | 29-page research paper (arXiv:1311.2159v3) defining algebraic elliptic cohomology from Krichever's elliptic genus as an oriented cohomology theory, proving the ideal generated by classical flop differences coincides with the elliptic genus kernel (generalizing Totaro's theorem to arbitrary perfect fields) |
