# Bourni, Theodora

## Overview

Job application package for Dr. Theodora Bourni, candidate for the 2016 ANU Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor position in Mathematical Science (Female Only, Job no. 511070). Contains complete application materials including CV, research and teaching statements, cover letter, six strong reference letters from leading mathematicians (Gerhard Huisken, Felix Schulze, Klaus Ecker, Giuseppe Tinaglia, Leon Simon), and eight published/submitted research papers. Bourni is a geometric analyst with PhD from Stanford (2008, advisor Leon Simon), specializing in minimal surfaces, prescribed mean curvature equations, geometric measure theory, varifolds, and mean curvature flow with applications to general relativity.
