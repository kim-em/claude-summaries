# Bourni, Theodora

## Overview

Complete job application package for Dr. Theodora Bourni, a highly regarded geometric analyst applying for the 2016 ANU Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor position in Mathematical Science (Female Only, Job no. 511070). Bourni received her PhD from Stanford in 2008 under the supervision of Leon Simon, held postdoctoral positions at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (2008-2011), and was working at Freie Universität Berlin at the time of application. Her research focuses on regularity theory for minimal surfaces and varifolds, prescribed mean curvature equations, and mean curvature flow with applications to general relativity (particularly marginally outer trapped surfaces). The application demonstrates exceptional credentials with six strong reference letters from world-leading mathematicians including her advisor Leon Simon, Gerhard Huisken, and collaborators Giuseppe Tinaglia, Felix Schulze, and Klaus Ecker. The 35-page research statement provides deep technical exposition of her three main research areas, while the teaching statement emphasizes her experience with graduate-level PDE and differential geometry courses at the Berlin Mathematical School.
