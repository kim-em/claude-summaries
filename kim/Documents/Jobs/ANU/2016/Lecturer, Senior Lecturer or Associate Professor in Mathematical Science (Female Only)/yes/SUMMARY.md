## Overview

Top-tier finalists from the 2016 ANU female-only faculty search in mathematical sciences (Job no. 511070). This folder contains complete application packages for seven exceptional candidates representing diverse research areas: pure mathematics (algebraic geometry, geometric representation theory, noncommutative geometry), geometric analysis (minimal surfaces, mean curvature flow, mathematical general relativity), and applied mathematics (topological data analysis, computational imaging). The cohort includes standout candidates at different career stages: recent PhDs (Bapat 2016), early postdocs (Turner at EPFL, Yang at UMass), mid-career researchers (Tran as Bing Instructor, Wang Hang at Adelaide), and more established scholars (Bourni with 8+ years postdoc, Wang Qian described as "truly remarkable" by Klainerman). Each application includes 4-6 reference letters from world-leading mathematicians (including Fields medalists' students and collaborators), comprehensive research and teaching statements, and selected publications in top-tier journals. According to Scott's notes from the parent directory, the top tier consisted of Wang Qian, Yang, and Turner, with Bapat in the strong tier.
