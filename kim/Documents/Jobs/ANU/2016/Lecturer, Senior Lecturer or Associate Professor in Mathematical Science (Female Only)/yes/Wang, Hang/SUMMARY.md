# Wang, Hang

## Overview

Complete application package for Dr. Hang Wang, a rising star in noncommutative geometry and index theory who applied for the ANU female-only lecturer position in 2016 from her position at the University of Adelaide. The application demonstrates exceptional research credentials through four strong reference letters from prominent mathematicians (including her PhD advisor Gennadi Kasparov from Vanderbilt and collaborators at Adelaide and Texas A&M) who emphasize her contributions to K-theory and operator algebras. The package includes her formal application with research and teaching documentation, along with published papers in her research area (papers subdirectory was not fully indexed due to size constraints).
