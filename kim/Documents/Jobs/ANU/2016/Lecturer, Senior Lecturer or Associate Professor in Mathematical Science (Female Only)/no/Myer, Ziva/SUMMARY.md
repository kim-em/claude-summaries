# Myer, Ziva

## Overview

Application materials for Ziva Myer, PhD candidate at Bryn Mawr College applying for the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences faculty position. Myer's research is in contact and symplectic geometry using Morse theoretic techniques to define A∞ algebras for Legendrian submanifolds with generating families. Her application includes CV, research/teaching statements, cover letter, and three strong reference letters from her advisor Lisa Traynor (Bryn Mawr), Joshua Sabloff (Haverford), and Katrin Wehrheim (UC Berkeley). Notable: no Australian work rights; expected graduation May 2017; extensive teaching experience as TA but no independent course instruction.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `application.pdf` | Complete PageUp application package (692KB) including CV, cover letter, research statement, teaching statement; PhD expected May 2017; research on A∞ algebras for Legendrian submanifolds using generating families; extensive TA experience at Bryn Mawr; EDGE program mentor; no Australian work rights |
| `Ziva Myer_Reference Report by Lisa Traynor.pdf` | Strong reference letter from PhD advisor Lisa Traynor (Bryn Mawr); describes thesis as "impressive work in laying foundations for generating family approach to A∞-categories"; highlights analytic challenges overcome (fiber-shrinking arguments, endpoint perturbations for transversality); praises teaching evaluations and community service; 4 pages |
| `Ziva Myer_Reference Report by Joshua Sabloff.pdf` | Research-focused reference from Joshua Sabloff (Haverford); emphasizes importance of foundational work establishing rigorous proofs for gradient flow tree compactifications; describes work as "important contribution" to understanding connections between generating families, contact homology, and constructible sheaves; notes careful mathematical rigor where others have only assumed results; 3 pages |
| `Ziva Myer_Reference Report by Katrin Wehrheim.pdf` | Highly enthusiastic reference from Katrin Wehrheim (UC Berkeley); compares Myer favorably to MIT/Berkeley research students; describes thesis as "big league" breaking ground in contact geometry and Morse theory; highlights technical sophistication in preserving topological information while achieving transversality through abstract perturbations; was planning to recruit to Berkeley; praises diversity/mentoring commitment through EDGE; 2 pages |
