# Ginges, Jacinda

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Jacinda S. M. Ginges, a theoretical physicist specializing in atomic many-body theory and QED radiative corrections, applying for a Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor position at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute in 2016. Australian citizen, Senior Research Associate at UNSW at time of application, with significant career break (2009-2014) for child-rearing. Research focused on violations of fundamental symmetries in atoms and tests of the Standard Model.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| application.pdf | Complete application form with referee details (Budker, Kozlov, Flambaum, Berengut); CV showing PhD 2004 UNSW, ARC Postdoctoral Fellowship 2004-2008, highly cited Physics Reports review (299 citations); cover letter and selection criteria responses; research/teaching vision statement |
| Jacinda Ginges_Reference Report by Dmitry Budker.pdf | Strong letter from Prof. Dmitry Budker (UC Berkeley/Helmholtz Mainz), world-leading atomic experimentalist; describes her as "one of the World's leading experts in extremely sophisticated atomic calculations"; predicts "stellar" resumed research career |
| Jacinda Ginges_Reference Report by Julian Berengut.pdf | Letter from Dr. Julian Berengut (Senior Lecturer, UNSW colleague); notes her pioneering "Radiative Potential method" for QED corrections; describes current collaboration on highly-charged ions; emphasizes uniqueness of her position to contribute |
| Jacinda Ginges_Reference Report by Mikhail Kozlov.pdf | Letter from Prof. Mikhail Kozlov (Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, Russia), world-leading atomic theorist/quantum chemist; notes her Physics Reports review is "probably the most cited review in this field" (~300 citations); emphasizes mathematical background and coding abilities |
| Jacinda Ginges_Reference Report by Victor Flambaum.pdf | Letter from Prof. Victor Flambaum (Scientia Professor, PhD supervisor, UNSW); describes pioneering work on parity violation in cesium (used to interpret Nobel Laureate Wieman's experiment), nuclear Schiff moments, and radiative potential method; won two postdoctoral fellowships simultaneously before PhD submission |
