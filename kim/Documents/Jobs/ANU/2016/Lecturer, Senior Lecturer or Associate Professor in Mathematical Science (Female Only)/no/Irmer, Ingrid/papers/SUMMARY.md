## Overview

This folder contains a single published research paper by Ingrid Irmer on low-dimensional topology. The paper, published in Algebraic & Geometric Topology (2015), establishes a fundamental connection between the Chillingworth class and signed stable length in the study of the Torelli group. This appears to be a representative work included with her 2016 application for a mathematical sciences faculty position at ANU.

| The Chillingworth class is a signed stable length - Ingrid Irmer - Algebr. Geom. Topol. 15 (2015), no. 4, 1863–1876 - MR3402331.pdf | Published research paper proving that signed stable length of Torelli group elements is a cohomology class equal to half the dual of the contraction of the Johnson homomorphism (the Chillingworth class); uses curve graphs on surfaces, orientation on edges, and Euler integrals to relate topological invariants; main result (Theorem 1) connects geometric actions on curve graphs to algebraic structures in mapping class group theory; includes proofs via pre-image functions, trace surfaces in 3-manifolds, and evaluation on bounding pair maps; funded by Singapore MOE AcRF-Tier 2 grant; 14 pages, genus g≥3 surfaces |
