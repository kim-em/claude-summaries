# Jiang, Jiaojiao

## Overview

Application materials for Jiaojiao Jiang, a PhD candidate at Deakin University applying for the ANU female-only mathematical sciences position. The candidate's research focused on applied statistics, complex networks, and information diffusion in online social networks, with a particular emphasis on rumor source identification. Despite having publications in IEEE journals and conferences, the application was from computer science/information technology rather than pure mathematical statistics, which was likely a mismatch for the position.
