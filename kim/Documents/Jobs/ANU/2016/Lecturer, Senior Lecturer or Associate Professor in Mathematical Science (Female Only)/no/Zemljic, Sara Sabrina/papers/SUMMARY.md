## Overview

Two published research papers from Zemljic's PhD and postdoctoral work in graph theory and discrete mathematics. Both papers focus on structural properties of special graph families: Sierpiński graphs (from PhD work with Klavžar) and Fibonacci cubes (postdoctoral collaboration with French mathematicians). The papers appeared in respected combinatorics journals (European Journal of Combinatorics 2013, Discrete Applied Mathematics 2015) and demonstrate her expertise in metric graph theory, graph embeddings, and combinatorial structures.
