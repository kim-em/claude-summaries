# Zemljic, Sara Sabrina

## Overview

Application materials for Sara Sabrina Zemljic, Slovenian mathematician and postdoc at University of Iceland. PhD Ljubljana 2014 under Sandi Klavžar in discrete mathematics; research focus on Sierpiński graphs, metric properties, and algebraic graph theory with particular expertise in Hamming dimension, isometric embeddings, and Fibonacci cubes. Publications in European Journal of Combinatorics (2013) and Discrete Applied Mathematics (2015) demonstrate strong mathematical contribution from PhD and postdoctoral work. International collaboration network including French, Slovenian, and New Zealand mathematicians. Extensive teaching experience in Slovenia and Germany (LMU Munich). Active leadership as President of ESN Iceland. Applied for both general mathematical sciences position and number theory/cryptography role. No Australian work rights. Application rejected ("no" category) despite strong mathematical credentials and relevant Australian connections (collaboration with Marston Conder at Auckland).
