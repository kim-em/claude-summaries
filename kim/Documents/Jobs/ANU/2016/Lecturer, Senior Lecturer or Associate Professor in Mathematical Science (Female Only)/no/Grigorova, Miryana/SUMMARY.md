# Grigorova, Miryana

## Overview

Application materials for Miryana Grigorova, a postdoctoral researcher based in Germany applying for the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences position. Grigorova specialized in probability theory, stochastic analysis, and mathematical finance, with PhD from Université Paris-Diderot (2013) on Choquet integration theory and risk measures. At time of application (October 2016), she was a postdoc at Center for Risk and Insurance, Hanover, working on systemic risk. Her research focused on model ambiguity, backward stochastic differential equations, optimal stopping, and Dynkin games. She did not have Australian work rights and could start September 2017.
