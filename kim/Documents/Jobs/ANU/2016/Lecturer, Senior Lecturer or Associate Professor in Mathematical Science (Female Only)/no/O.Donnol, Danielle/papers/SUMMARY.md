## Overview

Published research papers by Danielle O'Donnol demonstrating her work in low-dimensional topology, knot theory, and contact geometry. Both papers are peer-reviewed publications from 2014-2015 in quality mathematics journals (Osaka Journal of Mathematics and Pacific Journal of Mathematics), co-authored with Elena Pavelescu in one case.
