# O.Donnol, Danielle

## Overview

Application materials for Danielle O'Donnol, a candidate for the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences faculty search. O'Donnol was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Indiana University (August 2015-present) with research interests in knot theory, spatial graphs, contact topology (Legendrian graphs), and DNA topology. She held a PhD from UCLA (2008) and had previous positions at Oklahoma State (Clinical Instructor/Calculus Coordinator 2013-2015), Imperial College London (postdoc 2012-2013), Smith College (VAP 2011-2012), and Rice University (G.C. Evans Instructor 2008-2011). She had NSF funding ($144,577 for 2014-2017), publications in quality journals, and no Australian work rights. The application indicates she could start August 20, 2017.
