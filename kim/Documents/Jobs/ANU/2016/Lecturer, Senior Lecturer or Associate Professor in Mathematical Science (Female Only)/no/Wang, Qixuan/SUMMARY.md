# Wang, Qixuan

## Overview

Application materials for Qixuan (Martha) Wang, researcher at UC Irvine specializing in mathematical biology and applied mathematics. PhD University of Minnesota 2012 under Hans Othmer on amoeboid swimming at low Reynolds number. Research interests include cell motility, hair follicle modeling, developmental patterning, fluid mechanics, and PDEs. Extensive teaching experience as visiting assistant professor at UC Irvine (2012-2015) teaching linear algebra, differential equations, and calculus courses. US citizen, born in China, no Australian work rights. Four referees: Qing Nie (postdoc supervisor, UC Irvine), Hans Othmer (PhD advisor, Minnesota), Maksim Plikus (colleague, UC Irvine), Vladimir Baranovsky (teaching reference, UC Irvine). Published work on computational analysis of amoeboid swimming; manuscripts under review on hair follicle multi-scale modeling and noise/cell sorting in boundary sharpening.
