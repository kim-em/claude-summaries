# Corran, Ruth

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Ruth Corran, an Australian/British mathematician applying from the American University of Paris for a female-only faculty position in Mathematical Sciences at ANU. Dr. Corran is an Associate Professor specializing in algebra (reflection groups, braid groups, Garside structures) with 16+ years of research and teaching experience. Her application demonstrates strong research credentials (10 publications, international collaborations) and extensive teaching experience, though her publication rate slowed after having children.
