## Overview

Two representative research publications by Dr. Ruth Corran demonstrating her expertise in algebra, specifically in braid groups, reflection groups, and Artin monoids. Both papers showcase collaborative international research in combinatorial group theory and computational algebra, published in highly regarded mathematical journals (Journal of Algebra 2015 and International Journal of Computer Mathematics 2013).
