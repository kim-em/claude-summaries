# Hamieh, Alia

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Alia Hamieh, a number theorist specializing in analytic and algebraic number theory, automorphic forms, and special values of L-functions. At the time of application, she was a PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Lethbridge (Canada) with previous postdoc experience at Queen's University. Her PhD was from University of British Columbia (2013) under Vinayak Vatsal. The application includes 7 reference letters from leading mathematicians, comprehensive documentation of research and teaching experience, and one published paper from her PhD work on special values of anticyclotomic L-functions in Hilbert modular settings. Her research generalizes Vatsal's work on Rankin-Selberg L-functions from elliptic curves to totally real fields. Note: Candidate did not have rights to work in Australia and could start August 2017.
