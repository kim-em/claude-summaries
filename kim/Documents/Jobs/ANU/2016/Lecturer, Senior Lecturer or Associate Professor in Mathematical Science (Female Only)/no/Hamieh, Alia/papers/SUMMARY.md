## Overview

Contains a single published research paper by Alia Hamieh from her PhD work: "Special values of anticyclotomic L-functions modulo λ" published in Manuscripta Mathematica (2014). This is a 24-page technical paper in algebraic number theory that generalizes results of Vatsal on special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions in anticyclotomic Zp-extensions. The work extends theory from elliptic curves over Q to cuspidal Hilbert modular newforms over totally real fields, removing several restrictive hypotheses present in earlier work.
