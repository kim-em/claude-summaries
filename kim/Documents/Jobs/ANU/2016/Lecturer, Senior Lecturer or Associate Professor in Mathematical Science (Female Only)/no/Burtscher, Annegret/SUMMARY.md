# Burtscher, Annegret

## Overview

Application materials for Annegret Burtscher, a candidate ultimately not advanced in the 2016 ANU female-only faculty search for mathematical sciences positions (Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor). The folder contains the main application document (1.4 MB) and four reference letters totaling 1.85 MB from established mathematical physics researchers (James Grant, Michael Kunzinger, Piotr Chrusciel, and Roland Donninger). A papers subdirectory contains three published research works focusing on differential geometry and general relativity, demonstrating the candidate's research profile in geometric analysis and mathematical physics.
