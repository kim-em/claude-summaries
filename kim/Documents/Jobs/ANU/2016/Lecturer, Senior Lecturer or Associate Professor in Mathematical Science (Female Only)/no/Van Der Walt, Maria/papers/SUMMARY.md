## Overview

Two published research papers by Maria van der Walt and co-authors in GEM International Journal on Geomathematics (2015-2016). Both papers focus on advanced signal processing and time-frequency analysis techniques, particularly the development and application of data-driven methods for decomposing complex signals. The papers represent van der Walt's doctoral research work with advisor Charles K. Chui on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms (SST), and intrinsic mode functions (IMF).
