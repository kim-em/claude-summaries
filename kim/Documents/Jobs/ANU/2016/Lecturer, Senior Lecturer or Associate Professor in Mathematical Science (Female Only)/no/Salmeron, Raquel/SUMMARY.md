## Candidate Profile

**Background:** PhD Physics (University of Sydney 2005) and MBA. Lecturer at ANU MSI 2006-2015, then moved to industry (Network Performance & Analysis Manager at Airservices Australia 2015-present). Previous positions: Research Associate at University of Chicago (2004-2006), Aviation Analyst at Sydney Airport (1995-2003).

**Research:** Mathematical modeling of magnetohydrodynamic processes in protostellar disks; 16 refereed journal publications (65% as first author) in high-impact journals (MNRAS, EPSL, Meteoritics & Planetary Science); 349 total citations with 50% of papers in top 20% most-cited and 3 in top 5%; $580k+ in external research funding including ARC Discovery Project as lead CI ($321k); supervised 3 PhD students (1 completed, 2 ongoing).

**Teaching:** Redesigned and taught undergraduate mathematics/physics courses at ANU with improved student satisfaction (PHYS2020 increased from 3.0/5.0 to 4.1/5.0; MATH2306 enrollment grew from 20 to 82 students); innovative pedagogies including studio teaching, interactive applets, and discussion groups.

**Research areas:**
- Magnetorotational instability in protostellar disks (5 papers, 190 citations)
- Protostellar jets and outflows (8 papers, 144 citations)
- Chondrule formation in early Solar System (2 papers, 15 citations, featured in Nature Geoscience)
- Thermal structure of young stellar objects

**Professional contributions:** Invited to prestigious invitation-only workshops (Ringberg Workshops); founding member ASA Women in Astronomy Executive Committee; established ANU NECTAR Grant Application Success Working Group for early career researchers; initiated Planetary Science Seminar Series at ANU; reviewer for ARC, NASA Origins of Solar Systems Program, and top journals.

**Industry experience:** Leading team of 10 PhD-level experts in mathematical modeling and quantitative analysis at Airservices Australia; previously conducted high-impact modeling at Sydney Airport (e.g., extreme value analysis preventing costly unnecessary runway redesign; Olympic Games 2000 passenger/aircraft flow modeling).

**Distinguishing factors:** Australian citizen with right to work; former ANU employee (University ID U4372292); combines academic excellence with substantial industry experience; strong commitment to equal opportunity (spoke at ANU Women Promotion Information Sessions 2014).
