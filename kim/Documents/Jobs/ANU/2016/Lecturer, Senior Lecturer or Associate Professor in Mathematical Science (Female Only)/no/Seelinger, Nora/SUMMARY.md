# Seelinger, Nora

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Nora Seelinger, a candidate for the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences faculty position. Seelinger held a postdoctoral position at University of Haifa (Israel) at time of application; PhD Aberdeen 2009 under Ran Levi; research in algebraic topology, homotopy theory, fusion systems, and string topology. Previously held Research Fellowship at ANU (2013-2015) working with Vigleik Angeltveit on topological Hochschild homology. Application was not advanced for further consideration.
