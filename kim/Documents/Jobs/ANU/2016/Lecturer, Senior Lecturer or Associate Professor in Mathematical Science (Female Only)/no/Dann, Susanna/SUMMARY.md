# Dann, Susanna

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Susanna Dann, a candidate for the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences faculty search who was not advanced (placed in "no" category). Dann was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Missouri (2011-2014) and Assistant Professor at Vienna University of Technology (September 2014-present at time of application). Her research focuses on harmonic analysis and convex geometry, particularly the Busemann-Petty problem in complex hyperbolic spaces and intersection bodies. The application includes a comprehensive CV, research statement, teaching statement, reference letters from four mathematicians, and two sample publications demonstrating her work in geometric analysis.
