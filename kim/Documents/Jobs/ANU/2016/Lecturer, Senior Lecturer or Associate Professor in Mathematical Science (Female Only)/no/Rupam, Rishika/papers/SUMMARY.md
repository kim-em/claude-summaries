## Overview

Contains a single published research paper by Rishika Rupam and her PhD advisor Alexei Poltoratski on restricted interpolation by meromorphic inner functions. This 10-page survey paper (published in Concrete Operators, 2016) discusses the function theoretic properties of meromorphic inner functions (MIFs) and their connections to spectral problems for Schrödinger operators, covering topics including Clark theory, Krein's formula, inverse spectral theory, defining sets, and the uncertainty principle.
