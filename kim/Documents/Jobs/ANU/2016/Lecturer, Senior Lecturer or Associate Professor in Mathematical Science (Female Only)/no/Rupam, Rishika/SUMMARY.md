# Rupam, Rishika

## Overview

Application materials for Rishika Rupam, a CEMPI postdoctoral fellow at Université Lille 1 (France) applying for the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences faculty position. PhD from Texas A&M University (2015) under Alexei Poltoratski specializing in complex analysis, operator theory, meromorphic inner functions, and Krein-de Branges theory. Research focuses on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, completeness problems, and spectral theory of differential operators with connections to Schrödinger operators and inverse spectral theory. Application includes five reference letters (from PhD advisor, postdoctoral mentor, and senior mathematicians) plus a published research paper co-authored with Poltoratski on restricted interpolation by meromorphic inner functions. No Australian work rights; earliest start date September 2017.
