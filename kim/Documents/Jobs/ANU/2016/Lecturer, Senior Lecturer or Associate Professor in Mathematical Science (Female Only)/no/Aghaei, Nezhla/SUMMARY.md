# Aghaei, Nezhla

## Overview

Application materials for Dr. Nezhla Aghaei's candidacy for a Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor position at ANU's Mathematical Sciences Institute in 2016. This was a female-only recruitment drive (job number 511070). Dr. Aghaei was a postdoctoral researcher in mathematical physics specializing in super Teichmüller theory, quantum groups, and the interface between string theory, gauge theory, and conformal field theory. She had recently completed her PhD under Prof. Jörg Teschner at DESY/University of Hamburg (2012-2016) and was beginning a postdoc at University of Bern when she applied. Despite strong research credentials and enthusiastic references, she was not advanced by the selection committee.

## Narrative Assessment

The reference letters paint a consistent picture of significant intellectual growth. All four referees acknowledge that Aghaei faced challenges early in her graduate studies—Quella notes she "required considerable guidance" and "only slowly learned to work more independently" during her master's (2012), while Teschner observes that her mathematical background "turned out not to be ideal" for the demanding PhD project, slowing her down initially.

However, the letters unanimously describe a dramatic transformation. Teschner emphasizes her "remarkable development" and that "upon acquiring the background and training...she has gained a lot of momentum." The turning point, described vividly by Schomerus, came when she initiated a collaboration with fellow PhD student Michal Pawelkiewicz: "This required extreme determination, but Nezhla did not stop until the interaction had matured into a full collaboration that was very beneficial for both...This moment marked a remarkable turning point."

Post-transformation, the assessments become glowing. Teschner highlights her "initiative in driving the collaboration" and describes her as "among the most active students within the RTG 1670." Schomerus notes she is "on a strong upward slope and has now turned into a very fine postdoc, with some outstanding qualities," giving his "strongest support." Even Quella, the most reserved referee, recommends "serious consideration" of her application.

Her research on super Teichmüller theory is described as mathematically sophisticated and physically motivated by recent advances in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories and the AGT correspondence. The work involves non-compact quantum groups, new special functions, and intricate geometric-combinatorial structures involving spin structures on Riemann surfaces.

The application materials show strong productivity (1 published paper, 3-4 in preparation, multiple ongoing collaborations), extensive conference participation, teaching experience, and excellent integration into the Hamburg research community through seminars, journal clubs, and collaborative initiatives.

Despite these strong credentials and the trajectory of development, she was placed in the "no" folder, suggesting the committee may have had concerns about the initial struggles, the relatively recent nature of her breakthrough, or perhaps visa/work authorization issues (she indicated no Australian work rights and a distant Oct 2018 start date).
