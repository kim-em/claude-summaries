## Overview

Collection of three published mathematics research papers by Arielle Leitner submitted with her 2016 ANU faculty application. Papers span geometric topology (convex projective manifolds, SL(n,R) group theory) and combinatorics (universal cycles). All three papers demonstrate her research breadth and technical expertise in pure mathematics.

| A classification of subgroups of SL(4,R) isomorphic to R^3 and generalized cusps in projective 3 manifolds - Arielle Leitner - Topology Appl. 206 (2016), 241–254 - MR3494445.pdf | Main research paper on classifying 3-dimensional abelian subgroups of SL(4,R) and their application to generalized cusps in convex projective 3-manifolds; proves there are exactly 15 conjugacy classes and 4 families of generalized cusps |
| Conjugacy limits of the diagonal Cartan subgroup in SL_3(Bbb{R}) - Arielle Leitner - Geom. Dedicata 180 (2016), 135–149 - MR3451461.pdf | Research on geometric transitions and conjugacy limits of the diagonal Cartan subgroup in SL(3,R); uses nonstandard analysis (hyperreals) to classify 5 conjugacy limit groups determined by nonstandard triangles |
| Universal cycles of classes of restricted words - Arielle Leitner and Anant Godbole - Discrete Math. 310 (2010), no. 23, 3303–3309 - MR2721090.pdf | Combinatorics paper proving existence of universal cycles (U-cycles) for various restricted word classes including non-bijections, equitable words, ranked permutations, and passwords; uses de Bruijn digraph connectedness arguments |
