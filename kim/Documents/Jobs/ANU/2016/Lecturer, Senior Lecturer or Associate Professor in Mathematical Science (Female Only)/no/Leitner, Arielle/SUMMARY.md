# Leitner, Arielle

## Overview

Application materials for Arielle Leitner, postdoctoral researcher at Technion applying for the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences faculty position. PhD from UC Santa Barbara (2015) under Daryl Cooper. Research focuses on geometric topology, specifically geometric transitions of the Cartan subgroup in SL(n,R), convex projective structures, and generalized cusps. No Australian work rights noted as potential concern. Strong publication record with 4 published papers and active research collaborations.
