# Leitner, Arielle

## Overview

Application materials for Arielle Leitner, early-career mathematician rejected in the 2016 ANU female-only faculty search. Recent PhD from UC Santa Barbara (2015) under Daryl Cooper, currently postdoc at Technion. Strong research profile in geometric topology, with innovative use of nonstandard analysis to study geometric transitions, conjugacy limits of the Cartan subgroup in SL(n,R), and classification of generalized cusps in convex projective manifolds. Application includes three published research papers demonstrating technical depth across geometric topology and combinatorics. Four highly supportive reference letters emphasize exceptional research potential, collaborative abilities, and inquiry-based teaching skills. Lack of Australian work rights noted in application materials, likely a factor in rejection. Requested start date of September 1, 2017.
