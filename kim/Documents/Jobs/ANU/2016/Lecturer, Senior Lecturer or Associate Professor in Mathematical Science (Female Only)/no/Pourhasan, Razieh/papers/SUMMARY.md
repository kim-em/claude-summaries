## Overview

Research publication by Razieh Pourhasan co-authored with Robert B. Mann. Contains a single paper on holographic applications to condensed matter physics, specifically modeling heavy fermion metals using Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Lifshitz boundary conditions. Published in Journal of High Energy Physics (JHEP) in 2011 with Mathematical Reviews citation MR2889866.

| Gauss-Bonnet black holes and heavy fermion metals - R. B. Mann and R. Pourhasan - J. High Energy Phys. (2011), no. 9, 062, 16 - MR2889866.pdf | JHEP publication studying charged black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Lifshitz scaling; demonstrates these models can reproduce anomalous specific heat of non-Fermi-liquid systems at low temperatures; proposes holographic duality to Castro-Neto model of heavy fermion compounds; shows Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter controls temperature dependence of Sommerfeld ratio similar to characteristic parameter λ in condensed matter models |
