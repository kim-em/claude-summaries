## Overview

Rejected candidates from the 2016 ANU female-only mathematical sciences faculty search. Contains 29 individual candidate folders, each with application materials including application PDFs and reference letters. These candidates were not advanced for further consideration by the selection committee, as indicated by their placement in the "no" category versus the "yes" (7 candidates) or "maybe" (18 candidates) folders.

## Key Files
