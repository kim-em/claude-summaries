# Liao, Xian

## Overview

Application materials for Xian Liao, a Chinese postdoctoral researcher applying for Lecturer position at ANU in 2016. PhD from Paris-Est University (2010-2013) under Raphaël Danchin, specializing in partial differential equations and fluid mechanics. At time of application: postdoc at Universität Bonn working with Herbert Koch on Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Research focuses on zero Mach number systems, inhomogeneous incompressible fluids, density patch problems, and dispersive equations. Previous positions in Prague (2013), Beijing (2014-2015), and teaching experience at Chinese universities.
