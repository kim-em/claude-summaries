# Liang, Xuan

## Overview

Application materials for Xuan Liang, a PhD candidate in Statistics at Peking University (expected graduation July 2017) applying for the ANU Mathematical Sciences Institute female-only faculty position at Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor level. She specialized in environmental statistics, particularly PM2.5 air pollution analysis in China, using sophisticated nonparametric methods to adjust for meteorological confounding factors. Her application was not advanced for further consideration by the selection committee. Notably, she did not have Australian work rights at the time of application.
