# Angus

## Overview

Student work folder for Angus Gruen (u5561004) containing problem set writeups and a draft final report for MATH4349 Category Theory, Semester 1 2016. The work covers foundational category theory concepts (categories, functors, adjoints, universal properties), tensor categories and their relation to knot invariants, the Temperley-Lieb category, and connections to quantum group representations. The draft final report focuses on pivotal categories as a framework for constructing knot invariants including the Jones polynomial.
