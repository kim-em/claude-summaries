# CategoryTheory

## Overview

Special topics course MATH4349 on Category Theory taught in Semester 1 2016 with 6 students (Angus Gruen, Damon Goulding, Ivo Lopez, Jaklyn Crilly, Michael O'Connor, Rowan Cockett). Problem-based course covering classical category theory, tensor categories, braided tensor categories and knot invariants, fusion categories, and higher categories, with students submitting bi-weekly work and a final 10-30 page report. The course emphasizes connections between category theory, topology, and representation theory, focusing on modern applications like topological field theories and the classification of fusion categories.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| questions.pdf | Problem set covering classical category theory (adjoints, universal properties), tensor categories (representation theory, Temperley-Lieb, module categories, planar algebras), braided tensor categories and knot invariants, fusion categories (rank 2 examples, number theory, classification), and higher categories (field theories, Drinfeld centres, stabilization) |
| questions.tex | LaTeX source for the problem set with extensive bibliography references and custom macros for category theory notation |
