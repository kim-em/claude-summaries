# CategoryTheory

## Overview

Special topics course MATH4349 on Category Theory taught in Semester 1 2016 with 6 students (Angus Gruen, Damon Binder, Ivo Vekemans, Jaklyn Crilly, Michael O'Connor, Rowan Rowlands). Problem-based course covering classical category theory, tensor categories, braided tensor categories and knot invariants, fusion categories, and higher categories, with students submitting bi-weekly work and a final 10-30 page report. The course emphasizes connections between category theory, topology, and representation theory, focusing on modern applications like topological field theories and the classification of fusion categories.

Student final reports demonstrate the breadth of advanced topics: Angus Gruen explored pivotal categories and the Jones polynomial; Damon Binder presented an original categorical construction of the real numbers as a terminal object; Ivo Vekemans introduced model categories for homotopy theory; Jaklyn Crilly proved the equivalence between the Temperley-Lieb category and Rep(Uq(sl(2))); Michael O'Connor examined Mac Lane's Monoidal Coherence Theorem; and Rowan Rowlands compared three types of Grothendieck groups in triangulated categories. The work shows students engaging with both foundational theory (adjoints, universal properties, monoidal structures) and cutting-edge applications in mathematical physics, knot theory, and homological algebra.
