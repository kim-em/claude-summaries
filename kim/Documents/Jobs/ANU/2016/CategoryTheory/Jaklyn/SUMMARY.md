# Jaklyn

## Overview

Student work by Jaklyn Crilly (u5354271@anu.edu.au) for the MATH4349 Category Theory special topics course in Semester 1 2016. Contains two substantial mathematical documents: an 8-page introduction to category theory covering foundational concepts (categories, functors, universal properties, and adjunctions), and a 13-page draft final report on the Temperley-Lieb category and its equivalence with representations of the quantized universal enveloping algebra Uq(sl(2)).

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Category Theory.pdf | 8-page foundational reference covering category theory basics including definitions of categories, functors, natural transformations, universal properties (limits, colimits, products, equalizers, pullbacks), and three equivalent definitions of adjunctions with partial proofs of equivalence |
| Crilly - draft final report.pdf | 13-page draft final report proving the equivalence between the Temperley-Lieb category and Rep(Uq(sl(2))), covering Temperley-Lieb diagrams, Jones-Wenzl idempotents, Karoubi envelopes, quantized universal enveloping algebras, and irreducible representations (assumes q is not a root of unity) |
