# Michael

## Overview

Work by student Michael O'Connor (also referenced as Michael Joseph, u5717273) for the 2016 Category Theory course. Contains bi-weekly exercise submissions and a final report on Mac Lane's Monoidal Coherence Theorem. The student's work demonstrates engagement with foundational category theory concepts including products, equalisers, monoidal categories, and coherence theorems.

## Key Files
