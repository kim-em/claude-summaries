# Ivo

## Overview

Student work by Ivo Vekemans (u5765831) for the MATH4349 Category Theory special topics course, containing bi-weekly problem writeups and a draft final report. The work covers foundational category theory topics including products and coproducts, groupoids, graded and filtered vector spaces with functors between them, and an introduction to model categories - a framework for doing homotopy theory in arbitrary categories.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Category Theory Writing 1.pdf | Week 3 writeup proving that the product of categories satisfies the universal property and that the coproduct of groups is their free product |
| Category Theory Writing 2.pdf | Week 5 writeup proving every category contains a maximal groupoid, defining the categories GrVect (graded vector spaces) and FilVect (filtered vector spaces), and constructing functors between them |
| Vekemans - draft final report.pdf | Draft final report on model categories, introducing the definition with five axioms (limit, two-out-of-three, retract, lifting, factorization) and proving key propositions including that any two of the three morphism classes (weak equivalences, cofibrations, fibrations) determines the third |
| Vekemans - comments on draft.pdf | Annotated version of the draft final report with handwritten feedback and corrections, including notes on writing style, mathematical rigor, and suggestions for improvement |
