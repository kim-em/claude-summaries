# Damon

## Overview

Student work by Damon Binder (u5591488) for the MATH4349 Category Theory special topics course in Semester 1 2016. Contains problem set solutions and a comprehensive final report on non-anomalous semigroups and real numbers. The final report presents an original approach to defining real numbers through category theory, defining R as the terminal object in the category of pointed non-anomalous semigroups.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|

| Questions 2.pdf | Solutions to the second problem set (2 pages, March 15, 2016) on functors between graded and filtered vector spaces, proving adjoint relationships |
| Binder - draft final report.pdf | Draft version of final report (16 pages, June 3, 2016) on non-anomalous semigroups and real numbers, includes incomplete proofs and "Note to Scott" comments |
| Binder - final report.pdf | Final version of the report (22 pages, June 15, 2016) presenting a category-theoretic definition of real numbers through totally ordered semigroups, non-anomalous pairs, and proving R is the unique complete ordered field |
