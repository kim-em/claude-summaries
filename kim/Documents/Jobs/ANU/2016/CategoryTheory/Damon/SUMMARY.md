# Damon

## Overview

Student work by Damon Binder (u5591488) for the MATH4349 Category Theory special topics course in Semester 1 2016. Contains two problem set solutions demonstrating understanding of fundamental category theory concepts (initial/terminal objects, limits/colimits, tensor products, adjunctions) and work with graded and filtered vector spaces. The centerpiece is a comprehensive final report presenting an original categorical construction of the real numbers as the terminal object in the category of pointed non-anomalous semigroups, providing a category-theoretic characterization of R as the unique complete ordered field. The progression from draft to final report shows the development of rigorous proofs and complete mathematical exposition.
