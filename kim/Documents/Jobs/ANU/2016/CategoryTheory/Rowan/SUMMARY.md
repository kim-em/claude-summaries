# Rowan

## Overview

Student work by Rowan Rowlands (u5375288) for the MATH4349 Category Theory course, consisting of two problem set submissions and a draft final report on Grothendieck groups. The work progresses from foundational topics (tensor products and duals, abelianisation as an adjoint functor) to an advanced comparison of three types of Grothendieck groups in the final report.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Category theory report 1.pdf | Assignment on tensor products and duals (March 4, 2016) - proves that the standard vector space tensor product satisfies the universal property and that the usual dual space is a categorical dual in the monoidal category of vector spaces |
| Category theory report 2.pdf | Assignment on adjoint functors (March 18, 2016) - proves that the forgetful functor from abelian groups to groups is right adjoint to the abelianisation functor, with natural bijection and naturality diagram |
| Rowlands - draft final report.pdf | Draft final report comparing the three Grothendieck groups: split, exact, and triangular (14 pages) - defines triangulated categories with six axioms, proves properties of distinguished triangles, establishes relationships between the three groups, and shows the split Grothendieck group is isomorphic to the triangular Grothendieck group of bounded complexes |
