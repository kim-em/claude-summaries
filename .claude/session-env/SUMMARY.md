# session-env

## Overview

Session environment state storage directory containing 389 empty session subdirectories (identified by UUID). Each directory corresponds to a Claude Code session and is created to store environment state, but currently all directories are empty, suggesting this is a pre-allocated or cleaned-up cache structure. This directory serves as session-specific temporary storage that may be populated during active sessions.
