# -Users-kim-projects-lean-row-reduce

## Overview

Claude Code session history for the `row-reduce` Lean project at `/Users/kim/projects/lean/row-reduce`. This is a Lean formalization project related to row reduction (Gaussian elimination). The sessions are brief, consisting primarily of a single task to create and push the repository to GitHub as a private repo at `kim-em/row-reduce`. Two agent sessions were spawned for codebase exploration but completed minimal work.
