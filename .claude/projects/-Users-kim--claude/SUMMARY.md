## Overview

Session history for Claude Code work on the `.claude` configuration directory itself - meta-sessions where Claude develops and maintains its own configuration infrastructure. Contains 108 JSONL transcript files documenting work on skills, plugins, commands, CLAUDE.md instructions, and other configuration improvements. This represents Claude's self-development work, including creating new skills, debugging configuration issues, and refining its own operational guidelines.
