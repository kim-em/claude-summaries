# -Users-kim-projects-lean-FeitThompson

## Overview

Session history storage for Claude Code work on the Feit-Thompson theorem formalization project (`/Users/kim/projects/lean/FeitThompson`). The Feit-Thompson theorem (also called the Odd Order Theorem) states that every finite group of odd order is solvable - one of the landmark results in 20th century mathematics. This directory contains 4,498 JSONL session transcript files (670MB total) documenting extensive Claude-assisted work on this Lean formalization, spanning December 7-11, 2025. Sessions range from small (~2KB) quick interactions to large multi-megabyte extended proof sessions.

## Key Files

All files are JSONL session transcripts with UUID-based filenames:

| Pattern | Count | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `*.jsonl` (UUID) | ~4,000 | Main session transcripts |
| `agent-*.jsonl` | ~500 | Sub-agent transcripts spawned during sessions |

Notable large sessions (>2MB) suggest intensive theorem-proving or code exploration work:
- `02c17a72-c877-4445-9754-7b0055a6af38.jsonl` (30MB) - largest session
- Multiple 2-5MB sessions indicating extended proof work
