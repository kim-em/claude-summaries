# -Users-kim-projects-lean-lean-fro-org

## Overview

Claude Code session history for the lean-fro.org website project (leanprover/lean-fro.org). Sessions from December 2025 focused on PR #201 which bumps toolchain/dependencies and updates the update.sh script. Work was done on the `bump-path` branch. Sessions involved reviewing GitHub PR comments (from Cursor Bugbot) about a shell scripting issue where `exit 1` inside piped while loops runs in a subshell and doesn't terminate the main script.
