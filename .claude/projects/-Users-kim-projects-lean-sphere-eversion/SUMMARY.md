# -Users-kim-projects-lean-sphere-eversion

## Overview

Claude Code session history for the sphere-eversion project, a Lean formalization of Smale's sphere eversion theorem. Contains sessions from November 2025 focused on CI maintenance and PR management. The main session investigated and fixed a CI failure caused by pip 25.3 removing the deprecated `--global-option` flag in the blueprint build workflow, and managed merging master into open pull requests.
