# plans

## Overview

Plan mode artifacts from Claude Code sessions. Each file is a markdown document created during plan mode, containing structured implementation plans with research findings, pseudocode, file modifications, and testing steps. Plans cover diverse topics including Lean 4 development (CI validation, complexity proofs, monad implementations), tool automation (summarization agents, round-robin scheduling), game modding (Factorio NPC mining), and web development (Yjs collaborative editing client).
