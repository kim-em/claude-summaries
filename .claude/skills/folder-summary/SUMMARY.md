# folder-summary

## Overview

A Claude Code skill that provides instructions and workflow for summarizing directory trees into searchable SUMMARY.md files. This skill activates when users ask to index, summarize, or catalog a directory tree. It references the claude-summary project (`~/projects/claude-summary`) which contains the actual tooling and agent instructions for performing incremental, two-phase (preliminary → final) folder summarization across multiple sessions.
