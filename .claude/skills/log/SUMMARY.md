# log

## Overview

A Claude skill for managing daily activity logs stored in `~/metacortex/logs/`. Provides structured guidance for creating, reading, and searching freeform markdown logs organized by date (YYYY-MM/DD.md format). Activates when the user wants to record activities, review past work, or log notes and decisions. Synced via the metacortex git repository for cross-machine availability.
